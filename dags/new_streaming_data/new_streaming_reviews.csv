172063,"one-shot record of a belly dancer; ""Carmencita Dancing,"" one of a series of Edison short films featuring  circus and vaudeville acts, displayed the... um... ""talents"" of a zaftig belly-dancer who agreed to undulate before the camera of the famous ""Black  Maria"" studio.   The dance was originally intended to be played in a Kinetoscope, a single -person arcade viewer connected to Edison's more famous invention, the phonograph. Through a pair of crude headphones, the latter device supplied an asynchronous soundtrack of ""hootchie-cootchie"" music.   The Kinetograph camera here employed is so new -- even to its inventors  -- that director Dickson has drastically ""overcranked"" the film, unintentionally producing one of the first examples of slow-motion.  Carmencita's titillating movements were considered by many to be  scandalous. Thus, the film prompted some of the earliest discussions of film censorship."
95541,"Banging Away..; Thomas Edison and William K.L. Dickson's ""Blacksmith Scene,"" was the first film shown publicly in 1893. This short is a brief look at 3 workers as they go about their daily ritual. Great piece of work for its time. In the early days of cinema, directors typically recorded everyday events such as the arrival of ships or workers leaving a factory. These short films were called ""actualities."" Later, with the advent of better equipment (which could record for longer), directors began to introduce more complicated narratives into film. 10* (10* Rating System)"
7065,unbelievable; I cannot understand how anyone can call this one of the greatest movies ever made. It is disgraceful and appalling. I guess it is still high entertainment to see white actors in black face and watch a film loaded with stereotype.
3739,"I'm still starry-eyed from it; I saw this last night on the Turner Classic Movies station.  Wow.  This is a perfect, shining, ebullient example of what was possible before The Code. The clever, witty, salacious dialogue!  The compromising situations!  The sheer sexuality permeating every scene, including the ones where the camera is on this side of a closed door!  I am so glad that I finally saw this film, and would own a copy immediately were it available in any format. There's a lesson here.  All together now: NEVER AGAIN with the censorship!!!"
1562,"Failed on every Front; Joel Schumacher who did an OK job on the third Batman Movie, has simply lost the plot on this one. Poorly cast with the exception of Robin and Ivy, this is far more like the 60's TV series than the comic books, and it just does not work. The Baddies are not menacing, Schwarzenegger rarely performs this badly and Uma Thurman, although she did an OK job was just a poor character. As for Batgirl, this is just too much. Bring back Keaton and Tim Burton and take Batman back to his dark roots. There is no future for Batman if it continues like this. 3/10"
8977,"Poor Casting, Poor script Poor direction.; I had so much anticipation before seeing this film. But in the end it seemed to be a poor cross between the history channel and a gay sex in the city. I won't summarise the plot as most know it already. The only person to come out intact was Val Kilmer. His almost perfect portrayal of an edgy, alcoholic, despot was breath-taking. Colin Farrell by contrast seemed not to be able to cope. Alexander was a notorious alcoholic, yet Farrell's character is remarkably sober throughout. The one time he seemed a little drunk was in killing Cleitus, in the party scene in India. Here he kills a man who has fought with him in all his campaigns, yet it the film he does it fully cognisant, fully sober and completely unbelievably. The so called homo-erotic scenes between Farrell's Alexander and Jared Leto's Hephaistion were so laughable they merit no comment. Most people seemed not be offended by their inclusion but rather at how badly these scenes were performed. The only thing I would ask the director is as Firth seemed so uncomfortable with the gay scenes why make these scenes so integral to the film? I know a man like Alexander is too big to cover in a film. But this was pathetic. Alexander the man who conquered what was then the greatest empire the world had ever seen. The man who founded countless cities, never defeated in battle, and persuaded men form the ""Hicksville"" end of Greece to fight to the end of the known world. A man who convinced older men and wiser men that impossible dreams could not only be dreamt but made real. This man in this film is reduced to an a character out of the OC, forever pondering the psycho dynamics of the situation in between getting his leg over with the next dark eyed, dark haired man. The script seemed to have been written by people that had drunk all the wine meant for Alexander. Come on guys you are better than this! The direction had no flow, no continuity, no consistency and in fact no quality. The only scenes that were reasonable were the expansive shots of the Mountains. But this director is no David Lean. No John Ford. And even these scenes seem to feel like some kind of travel show than an historic epic. When I watched this film, for the first time in a long time people started walking out of the cinema. I don't blame them. In short this film is complete flawed. But the greatest crime is that is could have been great but should have good. Unfortunately where this film needed a director like David Lean or Stanley Kubrick; we instead got someone that should limit his endeavours to the history channel. Anyone who thinks this film was good needs to develop an opinion. Simply opposing the opinion of the Conservative right in the US does not make for a realistic appraisal."
2174,"An Accomplished Tim Burton Movie; A Great Idea, Good Script, and Wonderful Cast. What more do you need? Answer - TIM BURTON He successfully creates a fantasy world for the living and the dead to share as only he can. This combined with solid performances from the entire cast and of Course Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice, you know your on to a winner. Keaton Brings Beetlejuice to life in this hilarious comedy, as he is called upon to help some ghosts excorisise the living from their home, with unpredicted results. This movie quite simply gets funnier every time you see it, and there is literally nothing else like it, that i have seen. Terrific 8/10"
8947,"Very good; I saw ""The Grudge"" yesterday, and wow... I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror-movies, and I really liked this one. There were so many 'surprise'-scenes (what's the English word?) that made you jump in your seat. Though, too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh. I think the most scary scene was... on the bus, when the face flashes by on the window, or when Yoko's walking without her chin. The make-up is also VERY good. Sometimes you could really see it was there, but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene. The boy was very good indeed, so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on. The next time I hear a cracking noise I will probably feel pretty scared..."
143027,"This movie was stupid.; This movie was totally ridiculous! My friends and I watched it and were totally disappointed. The movie has bad graphics. The movie has boring elements. Basically throughout the movie the girl seems to try to be a ""very"" close friend. The movie contains the usual bad guy trying to kill the main character. Only in this movie the girl, Allysin, doesn't save the day. The bad guy tries to embarrass the main character. The secondary character comes to try to save the day. She does a little by taking off the ring but thats all. She try to tell the main character about the bad guy by doesn't listen. Right before that main character about to die the secondary character yells out ""Danny""! The acting was horrible. Alyson Michalka was one of the worst people they could of picked. She needed some enthusiasm. Danny the character needed to be much nicer and less offensive. To top it all off they didn't even KISS! This truly was a bad movie full of demonic stuff. If you are a Christian I wouldn't see this movie."
143027,". . . is a great movie.; Amazing! Finally Disney produces a movie with some magic and something else besides love stories and mushy crap like that. I found the movie quite intriguing. Johnny Pacar and Alyson Michalka were great for the roles. I think Alyson's role in the movie wasn't that far off from her one from Phil of the Future. Pacar really got into the role and it made me really feel the emotions. Have magical powers and trying to keep them hidden within takes a lot of will power and secrecy. The movie really keep me on my toes, trying to guess what was going to happen next. As a whole, this movie is by far one of my favorite Disney movies yet. It isn't like all of the others. This is all fantasy stuff and all the other ones are real life situations. We get enough real life stuff at school, so when we come home we want to watch a movie that isn't like all of the stuff we go through at school. This movie ROCKS my SOCKS OFF!!!!"
143027,"What a great change; Now, the stereotypical Disney Channel movie is some ""Hooray for everything!""-themed movie about a young girl/guy struggling to get through middle school/high school. This is still about a young boy (around 16) and a girl (same age) trying to help him master his magic. Alyson Michalka doesn't stray far from her character on Phil of the Future with Alyson (wow, what a stretch with the name), perky, fun, and inquisitive. Yet her character in this movie has slightly more ""oompf"" than Keely. Johnny Pacar is very good at portraying Danny, struggling to keep his powers secret and under control. This movie strays slightly from the Disney Channel movie mold. It's a little more dark than past Disney movies, and I like the change. The writing is very good for a kid/teen movie, and the casting is done very well. The main idea of the movie is that Allyson (Michalka) is a teen producer on a new reality show trying to find the ""World's Greatest Kid Magician."" But all her prospects are a flop. Until she finds Danny (Pacar), that is. They move to the magic mansion, which leads to mystery, drama, and even betrayal. Well, as much betrayal as can be shown on the Disney Channel. All in all, I commend Disney on at least trying to break out of their stereotypes with this movie. It's entertaining, and you should at least try to check it out. Michalka and Bacar have great on-screen friend chemistry, even in the beginning, when they're less than friends. 7/10"
2997,"Good, But Not For Everyone; A truly original example of movie making, the concept of the movie is very refreshing and the gags are fresh and funny. Great direction, great cast and overflowing with fresh ideas, this film is a breath of fresh air. There is a problem though, it is certainly not for everyone; it is very weird and is more likely to attain a cult status in movie history than it is to become a true classic. That said, i did enjoy it immensely, and would recommend it to every movie lover who fancies something a little different. Try it, you might like it, and if you don't, what have you lost? 8/10"
1201,"A Classic That is The Greatest Spaghetti Western of All Time; ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" not only is a classic, the greatest spaghetti Western of all time (edging out Sergio Leone's own ""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965), but is remains a remarkable cultural artifact, one of the watershed films of the 1960s. The combination of violence, amorality and black humor set the tone for a generation of films to come, a pedigree shared with the Sean Connery James Bond films. Eli Wallach is outstanding ""in the role of Tuco."" In fact, it could be argued that this is really his film, as he is on screen longer than Clint Eastwood. Wallach's Tuco is one of the great screen performances, in all its vital, overblown vulgarity (and as we can see with the best performances of Laurence Olivier and Marlon Brando, genius in acting often skirts the boundaries of vulgarity). A brilliant performance in a brilliant film. Aside from Leone's outstanding direction, Wallach is the engine that drives this masterpiece down the rails into cinematic immortality! Eastwood is Eastwood The Icon, the great star of the post-John Wayne era. Clint's interactions with Wallach's Tuco are wonderful. Lee Van Cleef makes an outstanding villain as Angel Eyes. Not to be missed by any student of the cinema! Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is a text book example of how to shoot a widescreen film, equal to the great Academy Award-winning work of Jack Hildyard and Freddie Young in David Lean's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957) and ""Lawrence of Arabia (1962), respectively."
7367,"Brilliant. This one matches -if not out stands- Big Lebowski; First, I AM quite critical with films, and will not give my advise for good movies just because. When I started to watch this one, honestly, I did not expect too much, and was quite afraid that I might be just watching the ""sequel"" of the execrable ""O Brother..."" (that's literally the definition about this latter film I've read seconds ago in a comment and I do stand for it). Instead and quite soon, I was happily delighted, and really enjoyed ""Ladykillers"" as I did not enjoy any other film in many, many months, if not in a couple of years. Also, I do not like Tom Hanks, because I find his acting roles somewhat stereotypical, but in this one he is just... SUPERB! I keep wondering why this film is so underrated; it's UNDOUBTELY within my best 50 films ever, and I guess maybe it has to do with the fact that it is a remake and consequently there are comparisons. As for myself, I did not watch the original but soon will. Coen brothers are for sure at the best level you can demand for as directors (except again for O Brother), and I guess if John Turturro had had the role of one of the other three ladykillers (again, Tom Hanks is already great, and also is Tzi Ma, the general) then it would have been clearly better than ""Big Lebowski"", which already is one of the best films ever. Why didn't you hire him!? 10/10 for this one, and I haven't given a 10 to more than a dozen films in all. Really deserved."
31225,"Coach Carter was a good portrayal of a true story; I really enjoyed the movie and was actually inspired by the end of the film. The film was a little corny and syrupy from time to time but it was an overall good, positive film. I have read and heard so many comments about the morals and unacceptable behavior portrayed by some of the characters and in turn viewers bad-mouth the film simply because they do not agree with some of the behavior of the some of the characters in the film. But these people obviously missed the point of the film. Coach Carter was trying to instill values that he thought would help an entire community. The reality is that kids do have foul mouths, have unprotected sex, are faced with hard decisions (to have or not have a baby and selling drugs) everyday. We should all be so fortunate to have the opportunity to see a movie that features a person that actually tries to deal with these issues without making judgment calls and instead offer resolutions to problems. He offered resolutions to his team's behavior and left it to them to make the right decisions. This was good because they were able to see the consequences of their actions. When they made the right decision, they were able to see the positive consequences. When they made the wrong decision the players were faced with negative consequences and had no one to blame but themselves. The impact of a person of this magnitude is profound and if some viewers found fault with this movie simply because their reality is a little different at this moment then it was for the characters in this film is very unfortunate for the viewer. Because you never know when you might be faced with a person similar to that in the movie. You just might have to deal with this situation more personally than expected and if this happens what will you do? Because the consequences of your actions in a situation like this will be either positive or negative as well."
134429,"Not bad; The best Ezio Greggio ever seen and a good Renato Pozzetto are the protagonists of an unpretentious film. It was set between Milan and Riviera Ligure during an hot summer. Plot is a little banal, but there are many amusing scenes and also secondary characters are nice. Some scenes are almost unforgettable: the dinner with Pozzetto's relatives, at S. Remo casino, the night in boarding house for example. Some scenes are too politically correct, es. subplot with Pozzetto's wife; Ezio Greggio vote 9,5; Renato Pozzetto vote 7,5. I have seen better movies, but all things considered this is a reasonable movie. Final vote 7. P.S.: sorry for my English"
26242,"Really good directorial debut from Steven Spielberg.; David Mann (Dennis Weaver) is a salesman travelling across the long twisting almost totally deserted Californian desert highways on his way to an important meeting in his 1970 red Plymouth Valiant. He becomes stuck behind a large dirty and noisy tanker truck. After a bit of not too serious silliness, honking horns, trying to overtake each other and some slightly aggressive driving things turn very ugly. The truck driver (Carey Loftin as Cary Loftin) seems to become intent on pursuing David and harassing him, possibly even trying to kill him. David manages to stop at Chuck's Cafe a road-side café. The truck carries on and drives out of sight. David seeks help from the owner Chuck (Eddie Firestone). While trying to gain his composure and sort his thoughts out David looks out of the window and sees the truck parked outside, it has come back for him to finish the job. What does the truck driver want? Will David be able to loose him? Watch it and find out! This was the directorial debut from Steven Spielberg, and a fine film it is too. I should point out at this point that I am reviewing the original 74 minute cut, rather than the longer 90 minute one. I'm not sure how the long version runs, but the shorter one moves along at a nice pace and is just about right in length. There is only so much footage of a truck and car driving along a road that you can sit through and find interesting! There is basically only one character in the entire film, and that's David as the truck driver is never seen and his motives are never known. Everyone else is in it for a very short amount of time and are just people David meets along the way. The script by Richard Matheson never reveals the truck drivers identity or motives and I actually liked it that way, it sort of feels like your David more as he doesn't know the Truck drivers motives either. But on the other hand it also felt like you weren't rewarded for watching the film as nothing is made clear or explained. Overall, I would say that I probably just about liked it as it is, without revealing anything. Weaver is excellent as David, he has a few monologues during the film to keep the viewer clued into what his state of mind is and how he is thinking that work very well and somewhat compensates for the lack of other characters with which David could interact with. There are no other actors to comment on really. The truck itself makes for a menacing villain and it had a great ominous on-screen presence, it was always there constantly chasing David as it seemed the truck just wouldn't give up it's relentless pursuit. I loved the harsh sounds it made, it's roaring engine and when it revs up, I'm sure this was what Spielberg intended and it worked well as far as I'm concerned. The photography is simple yet clear bright and functional, it looks fine. I really liked it and it kept me pretty much gripped right through to the end, but as I said there is only so much footage of two vehicles driving along a stretch of road that will keep me entertained and I was getting a little tired of it by the end but just as slight boredom started to kick in it finished, according to the IMDb's 'alternate versions' section the long version has a different ending, the one I saw felt almost unfinished but quite realistic when I think about it. I've never seen the 90 minute version but I'm sure the 74 minute one is a tighter and better flowing film that doesn't outstay it's welcome. As far as the short version goes I wholeheartedly recommend it. A great debut film from Spielberg."
34045,"Don't ya just love to be confused?; Here is a film that will keep you wondering just what it's all about. For those who are into such movies, you're in for a treat. The familiar theme of going back to the past to ""fix"" certain wrongs is offered here with an engaging plot and a bang-up twist. Simon Cable is a wealthy young man who wakes up in a hospital after some kind of accident in 2002, supposedly due to wood refinishing fumes. We soon learn that he has been in this hospital before, in 2000, which is when his brother Peter was killed. His wife Anna comes to see him but apparently was somehow involved in the cover-up of the truth behind Peter's death. All of this is unknown to Simon, since he has amnesia (or so his doctor thinks) and now believes he has lost two years of his life. It is here that we movie-goers become intrigued, and the attention-grabbing twists do not stop. Who is the blond woman Claire? What is the secret of Simon's brother's death? Why is his doctor unfathomably a pediatrician? As Simon recovers from his accident, he seems to have flashbacks to 2000, filling the holes in his memory. Or does he? His doctor in 2000 makes a pretty good case that his mind is creating images that Simon feels are actually premonitions of 2002. Confused? Well, so's Simon, and we come to understand the ""real"" story in bits and pieces, just as Simon does. Eventually, he believes (based on a rather shocking incident during a ""flashback"" to 2000) that he can go back in time to undo past wrongs and, as in so many other films of this type, things do not go well. Seen it before, you say? Well, this is a well-wrought presentation of the basic premise, with a possible murder and wife/mistress conflict, some good editing, and more than respectable acting, especially from Ryan Phillipe (Simon), who seems to be blossoming as an actor, or at least is getting better roles. This is a good thing, considering that Phillipe is in every scene, and the other actors all have rather small parts by comparison. Big-name actor Stephen Rea as Doctor Newman is nothing to write home about, but that may partly be because his role is relatively less significant to the total story. The role of Simon's brother Peter, played by Robert Sean Leonard, is even smaller, and Leonard seems to barely walk through it. However, watch for Stephen Graham's portrayal of particularly crabby heart patient Travitt in the year 2000 scenes. In any event, go into this film with an open mind, and try not to compare it to others of its genre, most recently ""The Butterfly Effect."" The last few minutes of the film will make you rethink your comparisons anyway and leave you with a new confusion worth discussing at your favorite coffeehouse afterwards."
8376,"A feel-good movie for the geek in any of us...; I enjoyed this movie, entirely. Initially, when it first appeared in promos, it didn't have my interest at all. Then slowly I noticed this movie popping up in review boards, and flying off the shelves in stores... the other day a lady at Target asked an employee if there were any more copies, since the shelves were cleared. And at Blockbuster, all copies were gone. Finally, I had to see this... very enjoyable! Dang if it didn't remind me of me in some ways, from back in school. I knew I was a geek back then (early 80s), all into computers, drawing stuff, and essentially being a social outcast, in the corners at the school dances. I only wish I knew a geeky gal back then to somehow connect with! If you listen to the commentary, a good deal of the events and setups in the movie come directly out of the writer's personal life, and he mentions ""nostalgia"" especially relating to music of the time. I can relate completely. Great movie. I had to check out the actor's profiles to determine if there was any realism in the personalities coming through... was Jon (Napoleon) really that geeky in real life? Maybe a bit, but pulling all these quirks of personalities off is a testament to their skill... all of them. I do believe Deb is my favourite character... what a sweetheart. I don't buy too many DVDs, but this one is certainly on my list."
155493,"Great Movie; Throughly intense. Just goes to show why you should never judge a book by its cover. Charles Durning portrayal of an aging veteran is both surprising and fantastic. He's not the usual Gibson or Jackson type star Hollywood would use to enhance this character. The really scary factor in this movie is that it could actually happen anywhere. there's no super movie special effects, just straight out home brewed justice. This movie not only illustrates social and cultural stress of changing urban demographics, it delves deep into the psyche of post traumatic stress that many war veterans live with on a daily basis. Definitely a must see, you may never look at your war veteran neighbor the same again. Now, if this would only be distributed on DVD!"
3156,"A beautifully  Innocent Film; Firstly, i have not read Asimov's book and therefore cannot remark on any errors in translation from book to film. I have read many of the comments posted here on the IMDb, but fail to see why so many people feel the need to mention that the world is perceived as perfect in the the future, maybe it is, maybe it isn't, the fact is, it's not important. This movie quite simply follows the life of a man trapped in a robots body and his quest to be accepted in the world, and be allowed to love and cherish the people close to him. I have to say that i didn't expect much from this movie, i thought it would be a kids film, full of typical Robin Williams style laughs, i was way off in my assumption. This is probably Robin Williams's best performance and it is a very emotional journey through change and development of the human condition. Overall the film is quite amusing, very touching and is full of realistic characters all very well cast to not overshadow 'Andrew' as he quests over 200 years for acceptance. A great movie 9/10"
2693,"A roller coaster documentary; While Star Trek is a viewpoint to a promising future, ""Trekkies"" is a delightful insight into another world of today. As a European non-Star Trek-fan it is a bit tricky to grasp exactly how important the phenomenon have been in the formation of American culture throughout the 60's and up to today. Although the intention of the filmmakers certainly is to make a movie about Star Trek fans as individuals - and not so much the phenomena itself - this aspect is also emphasized and explained to a certain degree. The characters varies wildly, from the somewhat too-much-of-a-fan-to-be-real to the more self-conscious enthusiasts with a fascinating insight both in the world in which they have chosen to dwell in and the individuals they are. The editing is often set to fast forward and is a bit too quick here and there, so it gets a bit exhausting to watch at times. Although there is a lack of traditional dramaturgy here, ""Trekkies"" is really entertaining, funny and heart-warming. There are some touching scenes such as the story of the suicide note as well as a number of disturbing ones like the family all dressed up in Star Trek-clothing and, perhaps especially troubling, the story of the q-virus."
8983,"An experience of memorable action and colour; As a sequel and follow-up to the previous Zhang title Hero, this is a sumptuous story well worth seeing. It focuses less on the military aspects and although the rebel group depicted has a political motive, the story concerns itself mainly with love and romance where many of the scenes are one to one encounters. There are plenty of martial arts action sequences, and breathtaking landscapes as a background. Varying types of instruments are used for the background music, which are an interesting companion to the story, and don't over intrude. The costumes and settings are lavish and do a lot to make this film a worthy product of the Far East film industry. The dialogue is in Chinese, but the English subtitles are excellent."
6297,"A great, must see film!; A brilliant film with a cracking cast. A must see film. It is funny, Romantic, sad, action packed all at the same time. All of the people in it are brilliant, and it is a film you can watch over and over again!I recommend it both to people who have read the book and people who haven't, It is a film you must watch all the way through, other wise you may get a bit confused. I think Stanley (Shia LeBouf) is a brilliant actor, and deserves credit for this great film. I liked this film because it stays quite true to the book, and all the characters are enthralling and interesting, You feel like you know them by the end of the film, as they are portrayed so well. I also like the way the film flashes back to different locations during the duration, as without this you would be entirely confused. Patricia Arquette plays Kate Barlow very well.You must watch this film!"
31184,"A bad movie, a worse dub; This movie was never going to be in any sort of wide release, and it was never going to appeal to a mainstream audience, yet Geneon, the distributor and translator decided to release it sporting a new English dub track. And it is wretched. Horrible. The anime industry is in a boom period right now, and the direction it is going to wavering between good, solid, accurate subtitles that leave the original actors who actually care about performance, and bad Disneyfied recordings with sub par actors who ham it up like old 70's cartoons. I would compare these ""serious"" performances to those found in Waiting for Guffman. Yes, it is that bad. Pile on top of that a terrible script, and you're left with a shell of the original movie. That aside, the animation did look pretty at times, and I've seen the integration between the 3d and 2d animation praised as some of the best, but it really didn't work well for me. What they did good was try to incorporate some of the artistic style of the characters into the 3d renderings, but I don't think they went far enough and the difference is still too jarring. The characters obviously belong to a different ""world"" then their backgrounds. This isn't a problem with in movies like Akira or The Incredibles where everything looks like it fits. Instead you're eye is constantly drawn to the difference, not the action. The story was far too complicated to be told in an hour and a half. It seemed interesting enough, albeit a little overdone filled with established sci-fi cliché's, but something that could sustain my interest for a little while if properly done. Based on a manga though, the movie tries to cram too much information and background into too short a time, something Akira also suffered from. Therefore, when major revelations about the characters are made, or huge plots wrap up, the feeling behind it is one of confusion and pointlessness. One is left to ask why they should even care. The cinematography was easily the best aspect of the film, some of the shots looking absolutely gorgeous, the animation tablet letting the camera move in some incredible directions. This sadly was limited to the actions scenes, sparsely scattered throughout. The other scenes where mundanely structured and shot, nothing about them pulled to eye to attention. All these problems coupled together created a pretty bad experience, and the audience I was with agreed, laughing throughout at the film. The only recommendation I can make is that by attending, you support the theatrical release of anime, which can never be a bad thing. But if this isn't a strong opinion you share, skip this film."
8870,"The whole movie is about living with paranoid-schizophrenia......; I never thought I would sign up for a movie discussion forum, but I'm compelled to since I think that many viewers of the movie have missed the whole point. It's not that complicated. No X-files-type alien stuff going on. Basically, this woman gets up everyday and sends her kid off to school. Some days she's OK, and some days, some hours later, she'll call her psychiatrist and say frantically, ""Where's my baby boy?!, Oh My God!, they've taken away my baby!!"" After spending most of the day running around town, making up all kinds of paranoid stories, and making up characters to support them, (who all end up being sucked up into the sky....did you notice that?), or looking for that microfilm of a plane crash that never happened (that must be disappointing when yer so sure it did....) our hero is relieved to find her son safe at the local playground, unharmed. THAT day she says it's just to straighten his coat up or something, tomorrow it'll be some other reason. If only her son had turned to another kid and said, ""Yup, that's my mom, she gets that way sometimes."", then maybe more viewers would've understood, but good writers and director's don't want to give everything away. So that boils it down for me. That's why many think it's a silly movie with a silly ending, when in fact it's a window into the life of those who are using our under-funded mental health system everyday... ...... THE FORGOTTEN.....! cheers, HJ"
8810,"An excellent sci-fi action film!; Ever since the comic books came out, I have been waiting for this movie to hit the theaters. The film did not disappoint! A research group is sent to Antartica to investigate a strange heat source under the frozen ice. Little do they realize, they are about to be thrust into the middle of a war the world has never seen. Great special effects and an interesting story makes this one above average. It is no where near the original Alien or Predator film, but it is great entertainment. My only complaint is the fact that they changed how the Predator looked. It would have been better if they kept the original design. If you are a fan of sci-fi action, definitely pick this one up. If you expect a film to match the original Alien or Predator movie, you may be disappointed. But people, remember, this is based on a comic book, so the comic book style should be expected!"
8917,"Funniest Movie I have seen in a movie theater.; We laughed from the beginning to the end. I have seen this movie 2x. I rank it among Blazzing Saddles, Young Frankenstien, and Longest Yard. This is the funniest movie that I have ever seen in a movie theater. More funny then animal house or porkies. The best thing the guys from south park have ever done. Really its that good. I am sure you will laugh at this movie. The Kim John Ill scenes with Hans Brix make me laugh so hard. The voice of Kim John Ill is amazing. The use of actors as a main theme to the movie is amazing. The Matt Damon puppet is so funny. The song Team America is so great. I give it a 10 out of 10. I could not believe how funny it is."
5010,"Not a huge fan of the Genre, but a Fine Movie; As war films go, i have to say i'm not really a fan, but i do like to watch a good movie, and thats what this is. Based around real events, this film and its brilliant cast delivers suspense, drama and action. The entire movie seems to be realistic in its depiction of war, in the same way that Saving Private Ryan is. This is a well made movie, that shows us that errors in war do occur, and that no-one can hide from the horrific repercussions of these errors. An emotionally charged, well made movie 8/10"
6264,"More Recycled, Formula Drek; From the opening moments the clichés begin washing up around your feet, weighing you down and dragging you to the core of boredom. There are the mysterious military personnel. There are the shots of Washington architecture. There is the talk of ""the academy"". So many Sci-Fi films and so many academies Isn't there a synonym for them? The blonde, blue eyed, square jawed leading man with the foreign speaking buddy both full of serious intent and off the cuff jocularity. ""Hey the planet's dying, but where's my pop tart?"" This time the pencil neck computer geek was too much with his nose borrowed from Cyrano DeBergerac. Then there is the awful science, the horrible editing so choppy it is like reading a comic book where great leaps of logic are required to fill in the gaps in the storyline...you get the picture. Rather, don't get it and go watch some paint dry."
6716,"Unwatchable. A sad sack of a film by a director with an unraveling career; It's been said that Peter Bogdanovich's ruin as a director was when he ditched his wife and artistic collaborator Polly Platt for ingénue Cybill Shephard. Platt had worked with Bogdanovich on all his early successes; after they parted company, Bogdanovich's career promptly slipped from the heights of a wunderkind to a has-been pursuing epic folly. ""Daisy Miller"" is one of his follies. I found the film unwatchable, primarily due to the poor acting. I then tried to watch the film for Bogdanovich's commentary, since I find his books such as ""Who the Devil Made It"" to be very informative. It didn't help. In his comments on the DVD, Bogdanovich praises Shepherd's performance and that of the juvenile James McMurty as Daisy's brother Randolph: both are execrable. Shepherd, at least, is a looker, but McMurtry gives an amateurish performance. Bogdanovich tells us that he cast leading actor Barry Brown after he and Shepherd interviewed him and liked him. He praises Brown's performance in the film, another bellwether indicating that Bogdanovich is -- and was -- painfully out of touch with the reality of ""Daisy Miller."" Brown promptly returned to obscurity after ""Daisy Miller."" You can see why watching his performance: He has no weight, and no voice, no real PRESENCE. Obviously, Brown was cast so as not to overwhelm the relatively talentless Shepherd in her ""breakthrough"" role. (Bogdanovich, always the name-dropper, recalls that Orson Welles said that Shepherd was ""born to play the role."" Does he understand the irony of Welles' comment? That Daisy Miller is a flighty light-weight?) The name-dropping Bogdanovich points out that Cloris Leachman, who plays Daisy's mother, won an Academy Award. If you consider Leachman's career, you realize that that role was her sole outstanding work in motion pictures. While she won multiple Emmies in TV as a comedienne, TV acting in comedy is not equivalent to the rigors of dramatic cinema work: just check out the career of Shepherd, generally considered a talentless washout in motion pictures but honored as an ""actress"" in the TV comedy genre with four Emmy nominations. Leachman is not up to playing Mrs. Ezra Miller; she lacks the gravitas. Why isn't Joanne Woodward playing the role? Woodward or Lee Remick, so notable in the Ivory-Merchant-Jhabvala adaptation of Henry James' ""The Europeans"" (1979), could have brought some needed weight and class to the film. There is nothing of weight in this film, aside from the lush costumes and beautiful scenery. This film needs to be anchored by fine acting to get across the psychology and internalized conflicts that are critical to James, but it does not get it from the principals. Shepherd was, and is, a fashion model in this film. There is nothing in the acting, aside from Mildred Dunnock, to attract and hold your attention. Bogdanovich whines in his commentary that audiences just didn't ""get"" this film, aside from Harvard students (Bogdanovich is forever the snob) who saw a screening and who had read the James' short-story. He continues whining that it wasn't until much later, with the Merchant-Ivory films, that Henry James came into vogue (as if this was all a matter of fashion!). NOTE: There were 26 films and TV plays based on James' work before ""Daisy Miller"" appeared, and 39 more after-wards. Boggdanovich's film was one of four James works in 1974. So much for the audience not ""getting"" Henry James!) Bogdanovich is as clueless as a commentator on ""Daisy Miller"" as he was as the film's director. The film is AWFUL and AWFUL precisely because of the director. He doesn't know how to bring out the film's theme. Bogdanovich tells us that the main conflict is that the character of Winterbourne is guilty over the seductions he has made in the past, and that he assumes that the innocent Daisy is as corrupt as he is. (Bogdanovich also says that Winterbourne remains clueless throughout the story, a clear case of projection of the director's own state of mind about his own film, about his own ""Daisy Miller."") In the scene, with Dunnock, in which this thematic point is ""made,"" we watch Brown twirl his mustache to indicate his great experience with women, as if he were some 1920s silent-film Lothario. Dunnock has to do the heavy-lifting via dialog in the scene. Yet, nothing comes across as Brown doesn't have the chops to indicate the existential state of his character. Brown is supposed to be WORLDLY! according to Bogdanovich. (In an early scene, Daisy's brother Randolph doesn't believe Winterbourne is American, mistaking him for an Englishman or a German. Was it Barry Brown's California accent that fooled him? For a person supposedly raised in Europe and schooled in Geneva, he sounds like he strayed remarkably little from Brown's hometown of San Jose.) Well, Brown's Winterbourne doesn't come across as worldly, or a guilty seducer; he comes across as a spoiled little boy, not much older emotionally than Randolph. Far from being a corrupter, he comes across as a brittle, timid soul who would be startled and severely off-put by the sound of a servant passing gas!) Rather than being the cornucopia of riches that is a Henry James novella, Peter Bogdanovich's ""Daisy Miller"" is a sad sack film made by a sad sack of a director whose strings were unraveling without his collaborator Polly Platt to draw them tight. This film should be viewed in film schools along with the Bogdanovich-Platt ""The Last Picture Show"" (1971) to debunk the ""auteur"" theory. Bogdanovich's career gives truth to the contention that film is an industrial process with many ""authors,"" not just one (the director). If the auteur theory were true, Bogdanovich would have returned to form eventually and produced more good films, if not another masterpiece. He didn't -- he didn't even come close. Bogdanovich will remain a footnote in cinema history, more valuable for his contributions to the literature of film than the medium itself."
936,"Delightful Romantic Comedy and Funny Satire to the Fight of Classes; Three Russian traders come to Paris to negotiate the jewels of a former Grand Duchess of the Russian empire. The former owner of the jewels, Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire), is exiled in Paris, and try to retrieve the possession through the French justice. Her lawyer and lover, Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas), advises the Russians to wait for the sentence of the justice. Meanwhile, the Russian supervisor Nina Ivanovna Yakushova ""Ninotchka"" (Greta Garbo)"" is sent to Paris to survey and evaluate the performance of the negotiators, and incidentally meets Count Leon d'Algout. They feel initially attracted for each other, and later they fall in love for each other. However, the Grand Suchess becomes jealous and their love become impossible due to the Russian closed political system. ""Ninotchka"" is a delightful romantic comedy and funny satire to the fight of classes. The chemistry between Melvyn Douglas, who has a magnificent performance, and Greta Garbo, gorgeous as usual, is amazing. The confrontation between the capitalism and socialism systems is exaggerated, labeled and caricatured, but very funny, provoking many laughs. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): ""Ninotchka"""
30810,"A bit of a disappointment, unfortunately; Wes Anderson's films aren't made for the masses. All his previous films have, to a great extent, been a case of love-it-or-hate-it, something that also goes for Life Aquatic. It's a film about film maker, and Costeau copy, Steve Zissou and his crew and family heading out on what could be a last mission, trying to find the mysterious shark that killed his best friend. Part comedy, part drama - and a whole lot of surrealism. Just like in The Royal Tenenbaums, Aquatic takes place in a sort of parallel universe. The characters aren't ""real"" and doesn't act like it either. With Tenenbaums it felt like they were testing how far out you could go, without being too pretentious and people still liking it - this time, it's even more weird, and the fine line between quirky fun and pointless fluff is crossed more than once. Bill Murray is great, but this is the kind of role he can do in his sleep, it's time for him to take on a more challenging script. The rest of the cast is made up of so many great actors that there's no way that they're going to get enough to do. I wanted to see more of them, so fewer characters would have been better. The plot gets too weird at times, and there's to much style in favour of substance. The literal fantasy world of the sea didn't really work either. The animation distracted from the other events in a way that the film doesn't benefit from. It's still a pretty entertaining film with some great moments and acting, but as a whole Aquatic never get's as good as Rushmore and Tenenbaums. 6/10"
541,"A work of the masters; The ultimate achievement for the sci-fi movies. 'Blade Runner' can hardly find a match. That cyberpunk reality which once inspired more than one PC game is exceptional. Harrison goes along the line as a hunter of human-like robots called replicants. What is human? What are we? What is the thing which makes us unique? You wanna know? Keep watching. Obviously Harrison falls in love with an android. Ms Sean Young playing as the android Rachel has made a centre of her website with the movie. Ewan McGregor reads the lines in 'Moulin Rouge': 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.' None of his discoveries, but can get a grip here. And the choreography requires an academy award. Rutger's done well too. His android is a killing machine and a lover losing his girl at the same time. The moment when he released the pigeon free along with his slowly speaking lines when he was dying, is one of few which ever made me reach out for my handkerchief. Give it a try."
8977,"The best movie i've seen in the year!; This movie is excellent! The cinematography and photography is remarkable... i liked the angles of the shots: those long shots with all the army before they struggle into battle is beautiful; also to see the perspective and all those elements framed. It has a great gay content: many conversations of Alexander with Hephaistion are really close... they almost kiss! Instead they hug each other... But you can see the love and caring each one had for each other, the loyalty of Hephaistion for Alexander and the trust the later had for Hephaistion: He saved Alex from his doom. If you don't like gay or bisexual content, these scenes were lightened up (i guess) to ensure general public's sensitivity don't gets hurt. It's a great movie.. worth seen besides of this. The customs, locations, soundtrack and movie titles... are excellent. They really did research on the outfits, because all the encounters with non-Macedonians tribes... are dressed the way it should have been: the Babylonians are dressed with those beautiful dresses and beard.. the same you see on the Babylonian statues. It's impressive they're reconstruction of Babylon! I heard it's walls were covered with lapis lazuli, but watching the recreation of it... it's amazing! All those landscapes were beautiful... it was like a 3 hour trip in a movie... from Macedonia, Egypt to India... Very nice... The soundtrack is very nice also, since you here those classic compositions of great movies with its overtures and the ""classic"" women voice in Gladiot's style, but this time with an Asian edge. Movie titles are excellent, since it displays all the symbols used in the movie, in a short sequence... Statues, eagles and ancient writing... with a nice blue light layered with slow fades between images and a liquid effect. Also, what i liked mostly was the use of Alexander's name in all those different languages spoken at the time: Fenician, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Greek and Babylonian, to mention a few. The performance of Colin Farrel is OK, the same of Angelina's and Jared's... Hope you see the movie and like it..."
3676,"A visual, creative trip into a world we hope we'll never have to live in.; Eraserhead is by far the most bizarre film you'll ever see. One time I asked my Dad what it was about and he said ""it's about everything except nothing."" That's the best way you can define Eraserhead. Eraserhead was an experimental film by the genius director David Lynch. Everything about it is repulsive, horrifying, disturbing, and yet there is beauty in how it all works so well. This is a very hard film to write a review on. Eraserhead isn't anything a film critic could analyze. The film is the way you interpret it (Spoilers) The world in eraserhead is a place where a man inside a planet pulls levers and there are horribly repulsive noises. A world where a paranoid man named Henry lives alone in his apartment, across the hall from a beautiful girl, has a girlfriend who is part of the insensitive X family, is the father to a hideous mutant baby, and has a very strange looking lady lives inside a radiator. That's what the film is. There is no way anyone can possibly interpret what everything is really supposed to mean. The film is how you interpret it. You might absolutely love this film, you might be horrified by it, or you might absolutely hate it. Everyone experiences Eraserhead differently, I'd suggest finding someone who has the movie, as it is very rare, and experiencing it for yourself."
26483,"Little known gem; If you're reading this you were probably there with me back in the early 80's, catching the rare broadcast of Rock & Rule on HBO, and desperately trying to get it on tape. In an age before residuals and focus groups preventing large-scale collaborations, an independent animation studio managed to get Cheap Trick, Deborah Harry, Lou Reed and Iggy Pop to score the best rock and roll musical animated film of all time. Robin Zander is especially impressive in belting out Otto's songs (my fave being ""I Hate You"") Good stuff I thought long lost to video irrelevance. But no! Independent DVD house now putting out massive package of all versions ever shown plus extras!! We're not worthy!"
26338,"Very Cool.....Marie-France Pisier is Great; If you have a playful sense of humor and enjoy films with an early Fellini (celebration of life-quirky characters) flavor, you should make it a point to watch ""Cousin Cousine"". Released in 1975, on the surface this is just an off-beat love story about two middle-aged ""cousins-by marriage"" who are drawn to each other by a shared playfulness. These kindred spirits awaken in each other a zestful and irreverent attitude toward life that distances them from their large (and somewhat strange) extended family. They want to experience as much of life as possible, the man has made it a practice to change professions (not just jobs) every three years so that nothing gets stale. They are very open about their affair, reasoning that the rest of the family will think the worst anyway. Not surprisingly their affair also distances them from their respective spouses, who do not share their fun-loving and irreverent attitudes. The lovers are played by Christine Barrault (nominated for an Oscar) and Victor Lanoux. Although they are fun and likable characters, most of the comedy in this film emanates from the performances of the actors who play their respective spouses. Guy Marchand plays Barrault's husband as a cranky and pathetic Cassanova whose philandering lifestyle is cramped by his inability to cope with his wife's sudden infidelity. Marie-France Pisier, as Lanoux's neurotic airhead wife, subtly steals each scene in which she appears; when a character introduces themselves with the revelation that the only time they have ever been happy was during hypnotherapy, you know that interesting moments are ahead. And for what it is worth Pisier is breathtakingly beautiful. The affair causes the Marchand and Pisier characters a great deal of pain for most of the film, but by the end they have pretty much adjusted to everything. Marchand has resumed his pursue of other women and Pisier has returned to her main source of pleasure-therapy. Marchand's regeneration occurs with his first playful moment, he mounts a knife (fake) in his back and staggers into the living room to the shock of the assembled relatives. While Pisier's regeneration is the best scene of the film. Alone and fully clothed in the bathroom, she half-heartedly tries to slit her wrist with a razor blade and falls backward into the empty tub, which she unexpectedly finds a pleasant and relaxing place to think. And how appropriate since the bathtub is a device we associate with privacy, purgation, relaxation, openness, and regeneration. They say that all films are political and ""Cousin Cousine"" is no exception. Films have the power to deconstruct the traditional values of society and this love story is also a social commentary on the hypocrisy and double-standards of 1970's western middle class culture. And while pointing out these issues it offers psycho-political messages that each viewer can relate to personally and specifically. The theme is that each day should be a celebration of life, experience, and growth. The grandfather is shown as someone whose long life has given him a real perspective. He is pleased when his teenage granddaughter reveals that she has discovered sex and found it to be wonderful, delighted that she has found something see finds wonderful and amused because her joy is so contrary to the nihilism she had been embracing. He is self-sufficient, the widowed grandmother from the other side of the family enjoys being with him but realizes that he is perfectly comfortable and prefers living alone. He is disturbed by the failure of the family to take any significant time from their lives to mourn his brother's passing. The strange antics of the adults in this extended family are a source of great amusement to the observant children. The carnival music score gives the many extended and flowing group shots a pleasing circus side-show attraction flavor. Note how the film opens with one of families driving to the wedding; parents in the front seat, brother and little sister in the back seat. The parents are agitated and scolding, the children calm and attentive to the experience of the moment. They go out of the scene with the little sister sliding over to be closer to her brother and smiling in adoration. The same little observant girl appears in close-up periodically throughout the film, smiling in amusement at the antics of everyone around her. The film ends with the little girl smiling serenely out the window as she watches the lovers leave on their motorcycle."
541,"Clearly a Masterpiece; This masterpiece, is probably the finest Sci-Fi movie ever made, and i can't see a reason for it not to have a place in everyones collection. The story, direction and cast are all perfect, and although i agree that the directors cut is better, i still believe that the original Harrison Ford voice over is pretty good, even if the end of that version was s**t. I first saw the movie when i was about 15 years old, and it blew me away (and yes that was the original cut of the film). At that age without the voice over the film would have been too difficult to follow, so i do have my reasons for liking that version. I also think that the original cut of the movie probably has wider appeal. My advice is this, see the original cut and if you like it watch the directors cut. If you jump straight into the directors cut, and don't give the movie your whole hearted attention, you will miss out on a masterpiece in cinematic history. Original Cut 8/10 Directors Cut 10/10"
26870,"Great Sequel To A Great Movie; I've probably seen this movie 15-20 times by now, and I know many of the lines word-for-word, and when they appear. Why have I watched this movie so many times, you ask? Because it was just that great. The first one was gold, but this movie was pure platinum. I thought the opening game was done to perfection, with the Indians losing to the Chicago White Sox. Well, except for the fact that Pedro Cerrano was already out for stepping out of the baseline before he was tagged by the outfielder, but that's a little inconsistency that only the baseball knowledgeable would catch. The losing highlights were priceless, thanks in huge part to the commentary of Harry Doyle, portrayed by Bob Uecker. Then the movie actually kept its consistency when the Indians started winning, and I believe it was great all the way to the end. Jack Parkman was the best possible antagonist this movie could have asked for, and despite the ending being a little obvious before it happened, I still enjoy it every time I see it. I don't know why many IMDb users have rated it so low, because this film deserves so much more. Too bad the third movie in this trilogy was a tank job, because if not, it would have been the greatest trilogy ever made. I strongly recommend this movie to the highest degree."
1675,"Relatively Unknown Gem; ""Incognito"" is one of those gems that you have to dig deep to discover. A relatively unknown movie, I bumped onto it as it was shown on the TV: I started viewing it hoping it to be at least watchable, and I was pleasantly surprised to realize that in fact it was really good. The story is about a highly talented arts forger (Patrick), who agrees to paint a fake Rembrandt picture for $500,000. However, things get complicated when a girl he sleeps with (Jacob) happens to be one of the experts to judge its authenticity, and she gives the painting thumbs down. As if this were not enough, his employers change their tune with him, and this is when everything turns rather sour... Jason Patrick is really good in his role; so good in fact, that I re-aligned my overall rating for him completely after this movie (it wasn't that high before that, as you can imagine). Irene Jacob is also good as his girlfriend, while Rod Steiger plays a small role but still manages to remind us of his grand standing. The film is well-directed, with the pace running smoothly; neither unnecessarily fast, nor boringly slow. All in all, a surprisingly good film: 8/10."
8957,"Bites off more than it can chew; Two men wake up in room, chained to the wall, a dead guy on the floor with a tape recorder and a gun next to him. That's the premise of Saw, a film that thinks it's more clever than it is. Obviously having borrowed inspiration from Seven (and other similar films), Saw is very entertaining for half an hour or so. Once the characters are established and the rules of the game are set up, the film stops dead. The story goes nowhere, relying on an onslaught of flashbacks to tell the story, leaving time for the audience to reflect upon the gaping plot holes, bad acting, and inane dialogue. Screenwriter Whannell unwisely casts himself as one of the leads, and from time to time, it feels more like a comedy watching him, Elwes, and Glover chewing up the scenery while delivering bad, albeit unintentionally funny, lines. The plot is also so reliant on characters doing (or not doing) certain things at a specific time that it just ends up defying all common sense. At first sight, Saw also seems to be a very gory film, but upon closer inspection you realise that it isn't true. Things are implied, but never really shown. I'm not saying that I'm thirsting for blood, but it would at least have made the film a bit different, rather than a rehash of old ideas and tired clichés. A promising start followed by, more or less, crap does not make a good film. However, the final minute was bloody brilliant - I'll give them that. 3/10"
6158,"Pale imitation of original, but not too bad on its own terms; Okay, so I'm a HUGE fan of the original movie - it's right up there in my top 30! And yes, this one misses a lot of the originality, personality and timelessness of the original. But putting that aside, this isn't a too bad little movie in its own terms. John Goodman and Haley Joel Osment put a lot of heart into their characters. I still can't believe Haley could pull off a musical comedy type role, where he actually sings **in character**, with a toe-tapping style and loads of charisma. Never figured the critically-acclaimed tyke had it in him. And overall, the voice casting is pretty much on par with imitating the original. Maybe the script is a bit to contemporary and clichéd, with the action story feeling a bit ham-fisted. Shanti does feel a bit too contemporary to the story. And the resolution for Mowgli between settling down with the humans and having his animal friends in the jungle does seem a bit too pat. But at least it's fairly watchable. A bit above the cheesy TV cartoons that are mass-produced now. If only slightly."
30810,"Fantastic; I have seen every Wes Anderson film several times and very much doubted he could produce another one in the same league. All my expectations were exceeded. This film was, in my opinion, the BEST of the four. The dialog, as always, was brilliant, and the animation added so much to it instead of taking away. I was totally charmed by the surreal underwater world. I was also once again reminded of what a knock out actor Bill Murray is... especially when he plays himself. I would suggest seeing all of the four films, especially since they are all very different. I can now proudly say that *The Life Aquatic* is my favorite film. And I say that not meaning ""of all the Wes Anderson films,"" but of the whole caboodle. See it."
3671,"A Classic Comedy; Mel Brooks madness, from start to finish. This is one of the funniest films i've ever seen. Good characters, which are well cast and perfectly executed, great direction and brilliantly written gags. The town appoint a black sheriff, and as the town folk fight for his dismissal or death, he cleverly (with the help of Gene Wilder) out wits them time and time again with hilarious results. A classic thats funny time and time again Highly recommended 8/10"
8981,"Relationships in Turmoil; ""Closer"" is a very dynamic film. It illustrates the turmoil of two relationships that are steeped in love at first site. Natalie Portman Alice, gives another perfect performance that even surpasses the prior one in ""Garden State"". Jude Law is excellent as the doting acquaintance who develops amorous click with his professional photographer, Anna, played by Julia Roberts. Clive Owen, plays Larry, the dermatologist who is duped into this original triangle by Law's character. Indeed, the duping on the chat room via the computer is a humorous comment on today's writing atmosphere. Jude Law plays a writer of an obituary column who is elevated to editor only because of the death of his predecessor. There is raw sexual exhibition in a London strip club. The story if dynamic. Mike Nichols has directed another winner. He has maintained his successful ability to communicate in film. Bravo to this cinema."
4994,"Majestic by name, majestic by nature.; Carrey plays a Hollywood studio screenwriter, scripting B Movies when suddenly accused of being a communist in the Macarthy era of the 1950's. His contract and current picture are shelved until the situation is resolved, his girlfriend leaves him and Carrey hits the bottle. Following a drunken car accident, Carrey awakes as an amnesiac and is cared for by the citizens of a small town who believe him to be one of their own - a soldier lost during WWII who has now been miraculously returned to his loved ones. Carrey believes this and begins naively to become part of the town and forming relationships with those within and a clean slate. This film has a premise with a little bit of ""Martin Guerre"", and a pinch of ""The Smallest Show on Earth"" (The Majestic of the title is a run down movie theatre which Carrey helps to restore). This is a suitably ""old fashioned"" picture that sits snugly in it's 1950's setting, with a good performance by Carrey in the lead. It doesn't quite reach the dizzy heights of Darabont's previous of ""Shawshank"" and ""Green Mile"" (could it be expected to?), and it does get a touch too much ""God Bless America!"" towards the end, but on the whole this is a beautifully, carefully crafted picture that takes its time to tell its story and is rewarding to watch."
3931,"Silly; Somewhere in the charred stick forest of rural Wisconsin, a Giant Gila Monster is on the loose, rolling cars and trains and eating people alive and off camera! When a young couple go missing, young hot rod mechanic and general good guy Chase Winstead launches his own investigation with the help of his gang of friends, his French speaking girlfriend, the inept sheriff and the town drunk. After realizing that their knees are not going to scare the Gila Monster away, nor will bad ukelele music kill it, Chase finally decides upon a deadly showdown with a hot rod full of explosives! This is a very silly movie with bad dialog and cheesy music. The acting is terrible, with the exception of the drunk, the Gila Monster (a real lizard on a miniature set) and Don Sullivan as Chase, even though you will want to hit him over the head with that damn ukelele before film's end. This is a weak entry in the ""Giant Things"" craze of the 50s, but it's not a total loss. There are some fun moments and a real Gila Monster as opposed to a clay model is always welcome."
5219,"awful; I saw the movie for the first time last night, and I was really looking forward to it. When I sat down to watch it I thought, this is so cool, especially when all the gas comes through the vents and the people die. Then it went from bad to worse. The story was very bland, and the zombies weren't even scary at all.The acting was so bad it was funny. The game was more scary. This was a complete flop. I felt as if there was pieces missing from the movie. Acting bad, props bad, and what was Milla Jovovich (Alice) costume all about? It was AWFUL. The only part I did like was the Queen. She seemed to be helping everyone, even though she was supposed to be bad. One of the worst movies I have honestly ever seen. D- all round."
4606,"An adoption film that tugs at Heart; I enjoyed this film because the characters showed how some adoptions go very smooth. Close and Woods portray Lucy and Michael, a couple that turn to this young boyfriend and girlfriend(Dillon and Masterson) for help; Masterson is pregnant and she first wants to give the child away. Lucy and Michael want to get closer to the young mother and invite her into the Spector household. Things go well, until Masterson has a change of heart,after the birth, and wants to keep the baby boy.She then realizes,towards the ending,that she has no experience and cannot fulfill motherly duties.Finally, she graciously gives the boy to the Spectors,knowing he will be well taken care of. This movie is sweet and you feel glad for the child, that a loving mother would sacrifice her desires, and offer him a better Future. As with a well known case in History, the ""Baby M"" scandal was a blemish to adoption agencies and received much notoriety in our Nation.Marybeth Whitehead was the surrogate mother and refused to give up the child. In that drawn out case, the girl even received two confusing names(then- married Whiteheads called her Sarah, while the Stern couple named her Melissa). In the ending of Immediate Family, Close,Woods,and Masterson show how adoptive and biological families can work out differences and still be happy. The Spectors send Lucy pictures and keep her involved with her child."
31221,"Dreadful Movie.  Worst Marvel Film.; Some Spoilers in this review: For the life of me I can't understand how so many people here claim they like this movie. While watching the movie I couldn't wait for it to end. Unlike all the other Marvel movies, there was absolutely no character development at all. All the villains seem to have supernatural powers which are never really explained. (One guy has animals come out of his chest. One woman seems to be an exact duplicate of Poison Ivy from Batman, minus any personality, etc, etc.) There's really no explanation as to how the girl she's protecting became the ""Treasure"" and just seemed like an annoying brat. Since there wasn't any character development, I couldn't care less about any of the characters. There's no emotional attachment between the viewer and the person on screen. Elecktra, unlike in Daredevil, was a cold fish in this movie barely showing any emotion. Then, most absurd of all, you have Elektra's assistant, whose only purpose is to make money, give up his life for two people he barely knows! As bad as the plot is, the action scenes were nearly just as terrible. Consider the scene in the forest. You have a guy who has a tree fall on his head that he knocks down! Totally ridiculous. Then you have the final fight scene in which Elektra was losing the battle. She gets up off the ground after being knocked out, puts up her sai and the main villain (who has unexplained teleporting powers) runs into it impaling himself. Completely stupid. In conclusion: Go watch Daredevil for a second time instead of seeing this because that, unlike this, is a good movie. 3/10"
4572,"A clash-of-cultures story.; Ridley Scott tends to give his films a very potent visual energy (see ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" for further evidence), and here he takes a story that's been around since films began and dresses it up with his customary pictorial trimmings. Black Rain is another fish-out-of-water yarn in which a cop leaves his usual patch to track down a criminal in an unfamiliar place (see also Brannigan, French Connection II, No Mercy, Beverly Hills Cop, etc. for other versions of what is virtually the same story). The unoriginality of it all is a bit disappointing in all honesty, but Black Rain compensates for its over-familiarity by excelling in other areas. Reckless New York cop Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas - looking more like his father Kirk than ever) and his partner Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia) catch a Japanese gangster named Sato (Yasuka Matsuda) in their city. They are assigned to escort Sato back to Japan and hand him over to the Japanese police. However, almost immediately upon their arrival Sato escapes with the aid of some of his underworld friends, cunningly disguised as cops. Nick and Charlie are left with egg on their face, and endeavour to help the Japanese police to recapture their man. They join Japanese cop Masahiro (Ken Takakura), but police methods in Japan prove very different to what the Americans are accustomed to, and soon differences in approach boil over into frustration and violence. Scott paints the night-time streets of Osaka as some kind of neon-lit, nightmarish maze. It becomes easy to relate to Nick and Charlie's bewilderment, and the viewer is left glad NOT to be sharing their experiences in the seedy, dangerous environment of this seemingly hostile city. There are some attempts to explore the different codes of honour by which the American and Japanese law enforcers measure their success. Also, the film establishes and sustains an edgy atmosphere (one scene, in which a key character is lured into a trap and beheaded, is especially tense). Black Rain is a mix of effective and not-so-effective elements. The visuals, the atmosphere and the cultural alienation of the main character are very interesting, while the plotting and dialogue are disappointingly familiar. It's definitely a film worth catching, though it probably won't be remembered as fondly fifty years from now as some of the director's other films."
157,"Brilliant satire; This is a collection of comic satires directed at American values. It should not be offensive to either Canadians or Americans, unless they have either really thin skin or are completely missing the point. People are surprised now (years after it was made) that this is a Michael Moore film. He should do more of these stories rather than his documentaries, because people can follow his stories better than his disjointed, rambling documentaries. Viewers who are offended by this are missing the picture; it's a looks at America's anxieties and obsessions, American politics, and it has some great comedic lines and characters. Steven Wright, Dan Aykroyd, and other comedians make cameos."
30749,"""Hotel Rwanda"" is an historical drama.; ""Hotel Rwanda"" is an historical drama with good merit. Terry George has directed this film independently, and therefore the budget constraints peek through. There is a very intense performance by Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina who does his best to save lives in a tragic situation in Africa. His wive, Tatiana Rusesabagina played by Sophie Okonedo is equally as inspiring in her empathic portrayal. Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, a United Nations Colonel, who is practically impotent in his ability to give aid to an impossible situation. Nolte is a drawback for he seems to read lines without any regard for believability. He fails to convince the audience that he is really a young United Nations military person. This movie is worth seeing for it's historical importance. An epic portrayal is lacking, but the essence remains. It is not a film of entertainment, but it is one for education."
30812,"""The Aviator"" flies high.; Leonardo DiCaprio gives an outstanding performance as Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator"". He evolves into a true replica of both the image as well as the persona of this complex character. Martin Scorcese is right on track in his direction of this excellent production. Jude Law is especially classy in his portrayal of Errol Flynn. Katharine Hepburn is portrayed by Kate Beckinsale and she gives a very convincing performance. Alan Alda is Senator Ralph Owen Brewster of Connecticut who assaults Hughes publicly in his Senate hearings. The psychopathy of Hughes is very believable and pithy. DiCaprio has obviously studied the psychiatric background of schizophrenia with intensity. One is overwhelmed by his characterization, and sympathy evolves for this extremely wealthy character of an earlier time in American History. The airplane scenes alone are worth the price of admission, and my hat goes off to everyone who participated in the making of this important movie. If one enjoyed ""A Beautiful Mind"", then this movie will be equally if not more provocative."
8640,"Ack, what happened here?; As many other reviewers have pointed out, this movie attempts to forgo the fantasy aspect to portray a more realistic Arthurian legend. If you believe Lancelot was a Spaniard that wore a black leather basket-weave blouse, that King Arthur was a boring and uncharismatic Roman lackey, and that Merlin was a mud encrusted Celtic hillbilly, then this movie won't bother you one bit. If you were hoping to see any of the relevant quests of the Knights of the Round or even the knights themselves (besides the aforementioned very ""Artist formerly known as Prince""-like Lancelot) you will be sorely disappointed. Whoever wrote this story obviously had little knowledge or love of Arthurian legend and after watching this movie I longed for the days when director Antoine Fuqua was merely a music video director (as he should have stayed). Whoever did the casting for this movie must have come into work drugged, drunk, and tired because everyone, save for Keira Knightly was horribly miscast. While Clive Owen has a place in Hollywood, it's certainly not as a leading man, and he proves it with the dullest, most lackluster performance of King Arthur ever portrayed on the big screen. I've seen high school drama flunkies that could do a more convincing Arthur. I wouldn't have followed this man to a Kwik-E-Mart, much less into battle. He was really much better off playing a driver in BMW-sponsored short films where his dialogue was limited to mostly one-liners. The acting was laughable and the movie in itself was utterly forgettable. I had gone into this movie with an open mind - realizing that such a legend could only be butchered by Hollywood - but so little did I realize how badly one could butcher it. I'm not going to complain about how far off this movie is from Excalibur (which is by far a superior movie BTW) because I realize they were trying to make it as believable as possible. I'm complaining because it failed to rouse even the slightest bit of interest out of me. I was bored to tears and when the movie was finally over I could only breathe a sigh of relief, forgetting momentarily the anger I initially felt of being ripped off by paying to go watch it. The ridiculous costumes and even more ridiculous dialogue paved the way for the most ridiculous rendition of the Arthur legends possibly ever made. Fuqua seemed to steal scenes from everything from The Last of the Mohicans to Gladiator, while never even approaching a sense of excitement or even entertainment. Surely someone must have spoken up during filming about the horrid costume Lancelot was wearing. He looked like Prince during his Purple Rain era - hardly the knight in shining armor I've been accustomed to envision. In fact, these ""knights"" were barely armored at all. Who would go into battle with a blouse on? Anyway, if you're really, REALLY bored, a 13 year old girl, and absolutely must have your sword-swinging, period drama fix - then give this movie a shot. Otherwise - steer clear. No - run away. Run far, far away. I'm confused - and you will be too if you try to watch this. Two thumbs down."
4085,"How can you not vote this a 10?; The movie is one of the best. Eddie Murphy was fantastic. The whole theme of the movie is hilarious and how someone cannot think this movie is a 10 is nuts. There is not many films that are out there, that can hold a candle to this flick. The movie is so funny, well written and has some great talent. Although the sequels were not as good, the original still is a top ten movie of all time. Don't forget the music was great. So between the script, actors and soundtrack.....This movie is a 10 out of 10 in my book."
7458,"Not much new here ... just a remake; What bothers me the most about this epic is that an entire war was fought over a woman. Will men ever learn that ""she"" is not worth it? She is not worth it at all. Aside from that... This is just a remake. Different actors, better special effects, and better costumes. But this is still just a remake. Hollywood needs to do something new. And why do movies like these always seem to be released in pairs? Troy and Alexander. The two movies about volcanoes. The two movies about asteroids. It was fine as a rental (it breaks the monotony of TV), and I'm glad that I didn't spend my money to see it in the theaters. I would never buy it."
7378,"This movie is a waste of time.; When I first heard about this movie I thought 'Great, this sounds good. Its gonna be a gigantic teen hit'. Boy was I wrong. This movie is literally trash. It hardly has a plot, the jokes are all old, and everything is stereotypical. The kind of family you find on sitcoms. A stressed dad that tried to keep everything in order but fails miserably, a 5-year-old girl who is a huge fan of Chuck.E.Cheese and wax crayons, a teenage rebel who refuses to wear anything that covers her thighs and stomach at the same time, a hip-hop-worshipping teenage son with a weird way of handling his dad and a mom that allows the father to take care of everything and watches her children disrespect their dad and just smiles. Its basically a family trip where they go to see their relatives, and they go there in a flash expensive car and fall from one problem to another. They do the whole fall-from-one-problem-to-another so many times that you actually get tired and uncomfortable towards the end. This movie is boring, and you've seen or heard every single joke here before. Don't even wait for the DVD. This movie is a disgrace to the film industry. And that is all I have to say."
1220,"One of my Favourite Movies; 1/ The music in this film is outstanding, with roles for Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles and more.... that's not really surprising. 2/ One of the finest car chases in cinematic history (The Italian Job and Smokey and the Bandit 2 are the only others that come close) 3/ John Belushi's own brand of comic genius throughout the movie 4/ Mulitiple memorable scenes and one liners 5/ Cameos from Steven Spielberg, Twiggy, Frank Oz, etc. 6/ Carrie Fisher as the psycho love interest intent on revenge. Nuff said, watch it and love it 10/10"
6746,"Icky; On a dark and stormy night in Yeehaw Georgia, a powerful electrical storm downs the power lines, and the electricity floods the muddy ground, awakening the vast population of worms! Unfortunately, the electricity doesn't turn the worms into Giant Worms, or mutant worms, it just makes them kind of cranky. Enter Mick, a wimpy antique enthusiast who has come to Georgia on vacation to visit his Southern Belle girlfriend Jerri, a scrawny redhead with an outrageous Scarlet O'Hara accent. Jerri lives with her whacked out mother and her odd looking sister, and is stalked by the local worm salesman's son Roger, a big dumb guy with an IQ of a cucumber. Mick's vacation turns out to be anything but restful, as he encounters a worm in a chocolate soda, a skeleton on the ground and a creepy sheriff with frightening teeth and gravity defying hair. By the time he and Jerri realize what is happening in the small town of Fly Creek, it is too late. The worms flood the streets and houses like an angry swarm of spaghetti, consuming any and all who stand in their way. Will anyone survive the night? I've never been able to figure out if this was supposed to be a black comedy or if we're supposed to take the worm threat seriously. Either way, the only thing this film did for me was to make me feel incredibly filthy. Filmed on location in Georgia, this film was also too convincing in it's portrayal of the rural south: I kept waiting for the banjo music to start up, kept waiting for Roger or the sheriff to ask Mick to ""squeal like a pig."" I couldn't feel sorry for the people who ended up as worm food because they were all so icky. I didn't care if young lovers Mick and Jerri lived to see another day - they're both so wimpy and whiny you won't care much either. The only character I actually enjoyed was Alma, Jerri's kid Amazon sister with her smart ass attitude and weird clothes. Other than that, I spent the majority of the film cheering on the worms."
8783,"M. Knight continues to impress; I have just seen ""The Village"" on DVD, failing to make it to the theater to see the first run. As usual, Mr. Shyamalan's movie is a delight to watch for both script and performances. After reading several dismal reviews about this film, I thought it would be good to level the playing field. First, Mr. Shyamalan has been referenced in several statements with the noted film maker Alfred Hitchcock. Although both film makers have the ability to project fear with both script and visuals (and I don't mean graphic visuals), each has their own style of film making. With each new film, Mr. Shyamalan grows as a film maker, a true story teller, which is a rare thing in current film. Second, the story itself is one of simplicity, yet grounded in realism. Simple in the fact of showing us the lives of the characters and the events that surround them. Realistic in the enlightening, not jaw dropping, revelation near the end of the film. Right now I am beginning a career in film writing. I can only hope to write something this good. Third, the fine performances of all, notably, Ms. Howard. There are no scene stealer's and Mr. Shyamalan has the ability to evoke low key, yet indelible characters that remain with you after watching the film. Finally, Mr. Shyamalan himself. One only needs to go back and review ""Praying with Anger"" to know that a great artist was in the making. Mr. Shyamalan does not just make movies; he tells us stories. When so much junk is green lighted and put to film, that comes and goes without so much as a twinkle, ""The Village"", as with his previous films, add to the genre not of thriller or horror or mystery, but to the genre of storytelling. A great ability indeed."
1339,"Visually stunning; Vampire movies seem to be one of the most popular genres in film, both past and present. I'm no huge fan of the genre, but this is an interesting movie well worth the attention. The solicitor Renfield is sent to far-away Transylvania to negotiate a purchase of an estate in London. The buyer is the mysterious count Dracula. Soon though it dawns on Renfield that the count is a vampire who plans on stealing his fiancé and having his way with the people of London. The book ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker is an interesting book i think. It's not what i would call brilliant in any way. But still the way it's told, in letters between the main characters and entries into their diaries, is interesting. This movie is one of the few i have seen that at least tries a little to follow this concept and does it successfully. I won't elaborate much on the story since it is well known to most people. More than anything this movie is a feast for the eyes and ears. The cinematography and camera-work is outstanding. The effects are also very very good and the music is a masterpiece from composer Wojciech Kilar. Gary Oldman is magnificent as count Dracula and further heightens the experience. The rest of the cast are also mostly well cast. Unfortunately one of the things that really disturbs me is Keanu Reeves portraying the important character Renfield. I can't understand why they would choose to use Keanu Reeves with a thick obviously fake accent when there are so many good British actors around. When will film-makers realize that the audience DO appreciate a good actor rather than a big name on the poster?! The focus in this film is on the love story. Something that contributes to the fact that you many times feel sympathetic towards the vampire. And it also lends a warmth to the story that many other similar films lack. Still this remains a faithful rendition of the book, well adapted for the big screen. Well made, mostly well acted and beautiful like few other movies. I would rate this experience 7/10."
7254,"Mindblowing; My parents told me not to watch this film. For it was ""impossible"" to grasp. But I insisted on seeing it, and it was no mistake of mine. It isn't a very difficult movie if you just try to understand what Evan is going through. He had black-outs where important stuff happens. He doesn't remember it, although all the people around him do. And those events change their lives, and with their lives changes the life of Evan. Evan wants that the people around him are problem free. He doesn't want Kayleigh to die and he doesn't want Tommy in jail. Evan finds out later in life what happened in those black outs. He even finds out that he can change the past and with that the future. The Butterfly Effect is never boring. You'll be thinking the whole time how an event he changed could change his future. A found myself thinking what he has to change. I really could understand what he wanted with his life and I tried to change it with him."
30825,"Very Funny Film; ""Meet The Fockers"" is a very funny film. The zenith of it's success is the performance given by Dustin Hoffman. He plays a middle aged Jewish lawyer who seems to have never practiced his trade. He is financially dependent on his wife, played by Barbara Streisand. She is a working sex therapist for the elderly, and the concept alone is a humorous one. She gives a fairly good performance in a role that is funny in it's own right. Ben Stiller plays their son who is introducing his in-laws to the folks in their humble abode in Florida. Robert DiNero is the retired CIA agent and father of the bride. He tries to maintain his inner circle of secrecy with his own family, but eventually bends under the psychological assault by the Fockers. The title is funny. Hoffman is funny, and the experience is worth the effort just for his performance alone. It is light, and can be a pleasing cinema experience. Do not look for a classic, but do find a very enjoyable couple of hours at the movies."
5128,"Weak; Vampire movies are a genre filled with many absolutely detestable movies. Sometimes a miracle happens and a Vampire movie can be very entertaining. But most of the time it turns out like ""Queen of the damned"": unwatchable. Lestat (you know, the character from ""Interview with the vampire"") wakes up and needs a way to cope with todays society. He decides to become a rock star, and his music wakes up the ""Queen of the damned"". A vampire queen that has been asleep for centuries, now she wants to rule the earth with Lestat as her husband. This movie displays almost everything that is wrong with Vampire movies. The acting first of all is terrible. Everyone walks around trying painfully hard to look cool in leather and rubber, most of them using thick fake accents since apparently no Vampire has ever learned to speak proper English. Worst here is Vincent Perez as the man who made Lestat a Vampire. Second of all it always seems that every film-maker doing a Vampire-movie has to try and introduce some sexual tension. Apparently Vampires are very seductive and alluring, something that the actors are usually completely inept at portraying. Stuart Townsend as Lestat falls completely flat in his attempt. There has been much talk about Aaliyah and this film since it was her last role before her tragic death. But it's hard to comment her performance considering she was not actually on screen very much. Her thick accent was not flattering though and personally i wish she would have had something other than this as her last performance. There is so much i could write about why you should stay away from this movie. But what's the point, it seems these movies have their loyal following no matter how poorly made they are. So i guess fans of the genre might as well watch it, while everybody else can stay far away from this. I rate it 3/10."
7367,"Sorely disappointing; I have just finished watching this movie and i can't really say anything good about it at all.I was so looking forward to it as i am a huge fan of the original with Alec Guiness.I've never been a fan of Tom Hanks and this movie confirms it!Every thing about Hanks' character is annoying.He continues to waffle on non-stop without actually having said anything worthwhile!The whole film seems to take way to long to get started and it fails to excite or amuse in any kind of way.So much so in fact that i popped out for 10 mins to make a cup of tea and came back to find nothing had happened.Do not bother with this film if you have seen the original.Its a waste of time and money.If you haven't seen the original ,go see that instead...you will love Alec Guiness!"
4051,"The Spiders of Whores Island; Silly, stupid, bad acting, worse dubbing, non-existent plot...I liked this movie! Manly and ruggedly handsome Gary and his sweet and shrewd girlfriend Georgia are taking a team of dancing girls down to Singapore. Too bad their plane catches fire and slams into the ocean at full speed. Miraculously, Gary, Georgia and most of the dancers survive this horrific accident with not a broken limb or even a bruise in sight. They wash up on an uncharted desert isle and find a cabin containing a corpse hanging in a giant spider web. Momentarily upset, they soon shrug it off and strip down to their underwear while a sultry sax plays. Gary wanders off into the stormy night after Georgia catches him playing tongue wars with one of the sluttier dancers. He never returns. Georgia and the other girls are now alone on the island...or are they? Some unknown menace strangles the slut and then disappears again, leaving the rest of the girls to go skinny dipping and wrestle each other in their underwear. When a small boat arrives, carrying the partners of the dead man in the web, there's time for a wild dance party and lots of making out before sailing home. Unfortunately, Gary has been waiting all this time (having done nothing but hide inside of a tree for the entire middle of the movie) and makes his appearance on this last night, ready to wreak bloody carnage! Gary has been bitten by a mutant spider and is now one himself...sort of. Actually, he looks kind of like Neanderthal Man with glue- on vampire fangs but we're supposed to believe that he is now a spider monster! The horror elements of this film seemed almost an afterthought, thrown in to attract a larger crowd. Really, this is just an exploitation film, featuring lots of curvy young women gadding about in their underthings, dancing, cat-fighting, swimming, bathing and seducing the young men who find them. It's a terrible movie, but it's amusing nonetheless. If you like cheap exploitation and aren't picky about things like plot, then you'll enjoy this one. It's a really poor man's Russ Meyer film...with spiders!"
3649,"Fails the test; When I come upon this film on cable, I will give it 15 minutes or so, but never sit thru it to the end. Summing it up, it contains characters I don't care about, doing things I don't care about, in a surreal, stylized world. If you like style, see Shrader's The Comfort of Strangers, a far better film about depraved people. Is it just my eyes, or is Nina P auditioning for the part of Sonny von Bulow? Every time she appears I think of the portrayal of Sunny. And who decided to stick that cigar in Elizondo's mouth? Hume Cronyn could pull it off in ""Postman"" but Hector, you look ridiculous, as if Shrader wants us to think what else that stogie could represent. I've read so many comments here about 80's style; if you want 80's style, get Body Heat, a superb film in a sun-blanched climate."
8948,"What's it all about, Alfie?; I do not get, what this film his all about... I do not get why the director didn't make this a typical Hollywood film and I do not get why this movie gets the same title as the ""Alfie"" of 1966. But I don't get the bad reviews either. If you just look past the remake, and think about an other title and another name for Alfie. You will find that you'll love this movie. I sure did. Alfie is a womanizer, that's not strange in this day and age. But he is a womanizer with feelings. He has a commitment problem. He cannot stay with a girl too long, because he will feel choked up. That's a common problem nowadays too. Why do you think this film was set up in New York, where there are thousands of beautiful women. Who are single and always available. As an Englishman Alfie has a lot of chance to hook up with them. With a lot of them. But in the end he finds himself alone. All the women he dated are taken and nobody wants him anymore. Not even his best friend. Soms say Alfie is too arrogant and too emotionless, to feel for him in the end, when he is left alone. But I think Alfie is just a typical man. He wants everything, but in the end he finds himself alone. With any luck he will find himself a girl like a lot of man. This is a good film. It captures what men think and what women think. I like it because it isn't predictable. It isn't a standard Hollywood movie, where the man ends up with the girl. It has a real ending and it is like the world we live in now. Not everything can be great. Some have to be happy when they have some money in their pocket..."
25861,"""From now on, I'm going after the two things I've always wanted most, good taste and refinement.""; Defying classification, ""Brother Orchid"" contains elements of film noir, gangster movies, and comedy, and showcases Edward G. Robinson as a mobster who quits the rackets because his tastes have outgrown them. It's a premise that walks a tightrope throughout the picture, and has Little John Sarto (Robinson) alternately swaying between his gangster life and a dreamy vision that may or may not be fulfilled. Although an entertaining enough film, I had difficulty in accepting Sarto's all or nothing approach to each of his mid stream course corrections. At the outset, when turning over the gang to his second in command Jack Buck (Humphrey Bogart), Sarto convincingly claims it's for good. But to leave his girlfriend Flo Addams (Ann Sothern) behind as he squanders his fortune in the capitals of Europe seems a bit overboard; for Flo to keep the romance alive even as she rises from hat check girl to owning the Crescent Club is even more of a stretch. Especially when a reasonably handsome and urbane suitor like Clarence Fletcher (Ralph Bellamy) comes along. Fletcher is charming without being pushy and seems more than a romantic match for Flo, considering her treatment by the almost repulsive behavior of Johnny. What does bring life to the film is the snappy, staccato one liners delivered by Sarto, often so glib that this viewer caught the full nuance well into the next scene. Then you have the colorful names of Sarto's cohorts - Mugsy, Philadelphia, Crack and Willie the Knife. Willie in particular is well portrayed by essential character actor Allen Jenkins, one of the few mugs who stayed loyal to Little John, even as he faked his way into a mental asylum during Johnny's hiatus. When it appears that Flo sets up Johnny to be ambushed by Jack Buck, Johnny makes his getaway to a reclusive Floracian Monastery, where the brothers of the order make their living growing and selling flowers to help beautify the world. Brother Superior is portrayed by affable Donald Crisp in a calm and self assured manner. Entranced by the serene way of life of the brothers, Johnny makes it his own, and takes for his name a personal preference - Brother Orchid. When the brothers' way of life is threatened by their inability to pay tribute to Buck's protective association, Little John is back to his gangster ways to set things right, but this time forming a gang of Clarence Fletcher's Western buddies who have hit town to attend Fletcher's marriage to Flo! Robinson and Bogart made a total of five films together, with Robinson getting top billing in all but 1948's ""Key Largo"". The others include ""Bullets or Ballots"" (1936), ""Kid Galahad"" (1937), and ""The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse"" (1938). ""Brother Orchid"" was the only film in which Ann Sothern appeared with either Bogey or Robinson. For fans of any of these stars, or of classic films of the 1930's and 40's, all of the films mentioned are recommended."
5687,"Distant voices...; 'Take Care of My Cat' is a thoughtful, sensitive and perceptive look at the lives of a group of young Koreans living in Inchon (Seoul's port city) as they undergo the difficult transition from students to workers. The characters of the different girls, and the changing interactions between them, are depicted with considerable skill and subtlety, as the film observes how the proliferation of mobile phones in society has not necessarily eliminated loneliness, and explores the (neo-Loachian) idea of the difficulty in maintaining relationships that straddle class boundaries. For a European, the film also provides an interesting portrait of contemporary Korea; awash with modern technology, but nonetheless still suffering from a relatively impoverished urban environment. The details are convincing and fascinating; the themes universal and profound, yet the film makes its points lightly and with grace. The result is genuinely moving experience. Definitely recommended."
6996,"One of the worst; This has to be one of the worst sequels ever made. Not that ""Highlander"" was a great movie to begin with. But still, destroying a concept so completely is almost enviable. It's the year 2025. The whole earth is covered by a shield that stands in for the ozone-layer that has been destroyed. Connor McLeod has killed all the other immortals and is slowly dying of old age. But something happens and immortals are suddenly starting to show up again and Connor must fight once again. I don't want to know which drugs the script-writers were using when coming up with the plot for this movie. How DO you start with a movie about immortal warriors on the Scottish highland, and end up with aliens fighting each other under a red sky in 2025?! Do we even want to know? It has to go down into movie history as one of the worst ideas ever. Taking something that was almost a solid story and destroying it completely by introducing weird elements like aliens and shields in the sky. So, apart from that? Well, even if we do overlook that major flaw this is still complete garbage. What did they pay Sean Connery to appear in this? Either he was well paid or the man doesn't take any pride at all in his work. The action scenes are pathetic, the effects are awful. Christopher Lamberts wheezing voice makes the VIEWERS want to slice his head off. I consider myself quite the connoisseur of b-movies. I can actually enjoy movies purely because they stink. But this is just so bad that it's not even funny. I rate this 1/10."
170335,"Entertaining but a lot of inaccuracies.; I am a retired oil company engineer and early in my career was a drilling engineer. Later, I worked as an oil and gas production computer automation system engineer on a project in the West Lake Verret field in the Atchafalaya Swamp just outside Morgan City, Louisiana, where this movie was supposed to take place. The movie was entertaining, but I found it difficult to watch without noting a lot of inaccuracies having to do with the location and the drilling operation. Usually in movies about the oil industry, the terminology is totally screwed up. In this movie, the terminology was generally correct, but the drilling equipment was nothing like the real thing. I chuckled when they pulled the drill string out of the hole when a blowout was about to begin. Blowouts are generally caused by drilling at thousands of feet of depth into abnormally high pressure zones for that depth and for the density of the drilling mud. When the decision was made to come out of the hole, the man in the control room just hit the controls and out came the drill string in a matter of seconds with no assistance on the drilling floor. In real life, it would take a crew of roughnecks on the drilling floor hours to pull out thousands of feet of drill pipe. Another serious flaw was the drilling equipment. Drilling rigs derricks are typically 100 or so feet tall to allow pulling drill pipe out in triples (three 30 foot joints of drilling pipe at a time). The derrick in the movie looked to be 30 or 40 feet tall, more like one used to drill water wells. I'm surprised the commenter from Louisiana didn't say anything the discrepancies between the real Lake Verret and nearby Morgan City. There are no hills as are shown in the movie. The highest ground in that area is the levees built up around the Atchafalaya Swamp and the bayous. The water is muddy, not clear as shown. The bottom consists of many feet of mud, not nice clean gravel. In one of the opening scenes, one of the teenage ""Cajun"" girls pronounces Verret, the name of the lake, with the accent on the first syllable rather than the second. Later other actors pronounce it correctly. I was impressed however that early in the movie one of the bad guys pronounced ""Atchafalaya"" correctly with a silent ""A"". Another thing I thought was curious was, although generally looking like a Cajun, Lou Diamond Philips' last name was Sanders, rather than something like Boudreaux. There are exceptions of course. Most of the rest of the natives had Cajun last names, but not him. Strange since he seemed to be portrayed to be a local."
5192,Worst Movie Ever?; This movie starts terrible and then just gets worse. Both Michael Caine and David Warner are movie whores who will do anything for money. Wasted talents the both of them. David Warner was acclaimed as the Hamlet of his generation when he was with the Royal Shakespeare Company and now look at him. Just look at his list of movies and you will see the dross he has appeared in. The Island and Beastmaster 3 are just two of his turkeys. He is capable of much better work but I doubt if he will ever be cast in anything worthwhile given his track record. Why do potentially great actors insist on selling themselves short? Sorry if this seems like a bit of a rant but it really annoys me when talents like Warners are prostituted like this.
3739,"I'm still starry-eyed from it; I saw this last night on the Turner Classic Movies station.  Wow.  This is a perfect, shining, ebullient example of what was possible before The Code. The clever, witty, salacious dialogue!  The compromising situations!  The sheer sexuality permeating every scene, including the ones where the camera is on this side of a closed door!  I am so glad that I finally saw this film, and would own a copy immediately were it available in any format. There's a lesson here.  All together now: NEVER AGAIN with the censorship!!!"
8984,"Why so negative?; Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, right? Good, because here's mine. I thoroughly enjoyed Ocean's 12!! I was wary to see it after reading so many negative comments here at IMDb, but am I ever glad we went to see it. Some of the negative's I take exception to, were the one's that said ""nothing was stolen in this movie"" and ""the whole plot of the movie was a kid's backpack being stolen"". With much respect I would like to ask these people: Were you paying attention AT ALL? Yes, something is stolen - two very valuable something's are stolen! Were you nay sayers, per chance, a)in the bathroom, b)getting a refill on your popcorn, or c)yakking on your cell that you apparently missed some crucial moments while they were happening? The cast is superb - yes, you can tell they are friends in real life and yes, the arrogance, silliness and comfort level comes across on the screen. So what? You'd rather see a movie where you can tell the actors can't stand one another? Yes, ""Tess"" portrays ""Julia Roberts"" - but what makes it funny and tolerable is that her portrayal didn't work. Yes, there is a ""lost in translation"" moment that you wonder, what the heck? - but towards the end, you see what the point to that was; ""Danny"" and ""Rusty"" didn't want ""Linus"" to have much of a role in the big heist. Yes, there is a Frenchman who does a break dancing scene - but the break dancing is pivotal to what he is attempting to do, and the Frenchman is one of the main characters! And personally, I liked the flashback scenes. Yes, the plot is tricky, and oh my gosh, you have to actually pay attention (what a concept, huh?) to keep up with the story. The nerve of this director, to actually expect movie goers to THINK ON THEIR OWN! Are there slow moments in the movie? Yes. Are there plot twists? Yes. Are there funky camera angles? Yes. Is this a worthwhile movie to spend two hours with? Absolutely. But that's my opinion. Best advice I can give to anyone is go see the movie for yourself. Don't plan your movie watching activities on the comments of others - not even mine! If YOU think it looks interesting or fun - go see it!"
110,"A Cinematic Treat; All though not 100% factually accurate, Gibsons romantically dramatised version of events is still a breath taking cinematic treat. The build up of the characters is perfectly paced, allowing the audience to be sucked in to the rationality behind the forth coming actions of Wallace and his followers. The action scenes contain digital imagery so seamless that you would not know is was there unless you were made aware. During the epic fight sequences you are propelled into the horror of the melee, and you can picture how savage these battles really were. There is also some light comic relief provided almost entirely through the Irish warrior 'David O'Hara', who really is a great character and i thank O'Hara for his fine performance. The amazing thing about this movie is the climax, incredibly powerful acting and direction from Mel Gibson, means you almost feel Wallace's pain. Your own imagination visualises this scene far better than any special effect ever could. A top film 10/10"
8949,"Saab versus convenience family-van; A melancholic comedy about two midlife-crisis-ridden Californian men, one trying to grasp life by seducing waitresses in the countryside, the other - more the intellectual type - withdrawing into a sophisticated mens-world of literature, golf and wine-tasting. Brilliant dialogs, but really this film could even do without the talking: just picture an old red Saab, manufactured sometime in the 80s on the motorway between all these new ""high- heeled"" convenience SUV's and you got the mood of Paul Giamattis character, who always seems to be in a silent struggle with everyday American way of life. Not to mention the surprising and absolutely beautiful split-screen-sequence in the middle of the film and the melancholy but compassionate use of the jazz-score."
8912,"Poor American remake.; I'm tempted to just write ""This movie sucks"" and then go see the original again, but that wouldn't be very helpful to you guys. Here's why this movie sucks. To sum up the movie, I steal from oshram-3 (One of the other comments) ""The plot of Taxi follows Detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon, making his debut as a movie lead) and bike-messenger-turned-cab-driver Belle (Queen Latifah) as they inadvertently get tangled up with one another and have to figure out who is ripping off a series of Manhattan banks and try to catch them. Rounding out the cast (no pun intended) are Jennifer Esposito (you might remember her from Spin City) as Washburn's lieutenant, Marta, and supermodel Gisele Bundchen as the head hot chick."" Luc Besson's action-comedy Taxi(1998) was a great movie, mostly due to decent acting, funny characters and social/cultural references. In this American remake, all that is gone. The characters in themselves are severely less intricate than in Besson's original, and maybe the best of them all is gone. I am, of course, talking about the utterly insane police captain. Then again, of course the Americans would leave him out, since he's a parody of every single angry police chief in American movies. All that's left is Queen Latifah driving a taxi, and a cop that's just pathetic, and doesn't have that likable quality Frédéric Diefenthal had in the french version. Also, the political correctness really shines through the gaps in this film. Every single strong character is a woman. The only guy in the entire core group of the movie is the awkward cop/disguise artist. The movie has been carefully constructed so it doesn't lash out at any particular groups in society, and by doing that, you lose the edge. I see this movie as a blatant attempt to salvage careers and make some money on the fact that Americans don't like subtitles. It's also a classic example of what happens when you let lawyers and politically correct groups scare you out of doing things right."
6242,"Three thumbs up!; I've seen about 200 horror movies, and none of 'em scared or compelled me as much as this one. This is also one of the few only horror movies I'd call an utter good movie, and not just a scary one. I've seen my share of Asian movies, so this wasn't something entirely new to me, but since this one is a fairly a-typical Asian picture, I think people from Europe and America can enjoy it as well. I love the way of implying rather than showing(like the Asakawa - Ryuji relationship). I love the way you never REALLY get a grip on Sadako's character, being torn between feeling sorry for her, and fearing her and her evilness. The static shots still give it a very Japanese feel, and the soundtrack is just awesome! Not the usual shrieking when something scary happens, but eerie, low tones. And I also love the way the movie doesn't explain every single detail without seeming incomplete. When I watch normal Hollywood style horror/thrillers I always get the feeling the filmmakers see us like some kind of morons, explaining everything 3 or 4 times... This movie doesn't do that. I watched it in the dark, 'round midnight, in my bedroom, and when I wanted to go to bed I just couldn't look at my TV... Still, when I'm alone, and I think of the movie, I kinda get the feeling Sadako is near or something, and no other horror has ever had such an impact on me. I'd definitely recommend this one to everyone who can appreciate subtle movies that don't use gore and gross things to catch your attention. And if you like this one I'd definitely recommend ring 0; basudei, ring 2 and dark water(very similar to ringu)."
1130,"Overrated Werewolf film, average at best as far as I'm concerned.; T.V. newswoman Karen Stone (Dee Wallace-Stone as Dee Wallace) has been contacted by and agreed to have a private meeting with a wanted L.A. serial killer Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo), she decides to use herself as bait to trap him with the police's help. Things don't go according to plan however. Before receiving a phone call from Quist in a public call box to let her know where to go and meet him her electronic equipment fails and the monitoring police lose track of her. Quist tells Karen to go to a porno shop and wait in a booth in the back. Violent pornography plays on a screen as Karen is attacked from behind. Two policemen (Kenneth Toby and Steve Nevil), having managed to re-locate Karen, burst in and shoot Eddie dead. Karen is traumatised by the event and cannot remember parts of it and decides to visit Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Macnee) who did a profile on Quist and was recently a guest on her T.V. programme. He suggests that she and her husband William 'Bill' Neil (Dee Wallace-Stones real life husband Christopher Stone) take a break from their careers and visit the secluded retreat he has set-up that is known as the 'Colony'. They agree and head off to the Colony which is situated on the California coast. At night Karen begins to hear an eerie howling noise. Meanwhile two of Karen's journalist friends and colleagues, Terry (Belinda Balaski) and Chris (Dennis Dugan) locate Quist's apartment and find some very strange drawings of half men half wolf creatures. They investigate further and discover that Quist's body has disappeared from the morgue, eventually the trail leads them to the Colony. After Bill has just rejected the advances of Marsha (Elizabeth Brooks) he is attacked by a large unknown and extremely aggressive animal. Soon everything is revealed and Karen finds out the sinister truth behind the howling noises, who Eddie Quist really is and the real purpose of why the 'Colony' was created. Directed by Joe Dante I was very disappointed by this highly thought of film, I just can't get that excited about it. The script by John Sayles and Terence H. Winkless based on the Novel by Gary Brandner is very slow to start and is full of in-jokes and references. It picks up a little for the last half an hour or so but overall I just wasn't particularly interested in anyone or anything by this point. Why is it that a werewolf can punch through a car roof but can't escape from an old wooden barn while it's burning down? The one thing this film does have going for it is some excellent special make-up effects from Rob Bottin and his team, Rick Baker who did the equally excellent effects for An American Werewolf in London (1981) has a credit as consultant too. The transformation scenes are impressive although there isn't a lot of blood or gore, in fact I can't really remember any. There is someone with half their face burnt off with acid and a chopped off arm and that's about it, but it's definitely the transformations that steal the special make-up effects show. There is a scene where two people start to turn into werewolves as they have sex, which is kinky I guess. It's generally well made and looks OK. The acting is fine and there are a few familiar faces in it, there's an extremely old looking John Carradine who can barely walk, Slim Pickens as the local Sheriff, Dick Miller plus director Roger Corman and screenwriter John Sayles also have small cameo's. This is also the only film that has the closing credits running over a shot of a burger being cooked on a grill, at least I think it is. Generally quite slow but there are a few good sequences in here if you stick it out to the end. Not too bad, but not brilliant either."
5794,"Haven't seen this movie...; ... but I guess I'd like it like other very personal Claire Denis movies. Mauvais Sang from Leos Carax and with Denis Lavant is also a personal favorite and I've seen it quoted somewhere. Just because a movie is stylish doesn't mean it's bad. Unstylish movies? Lots of them... Claire Denis succeeds in creating a very personal climax that makes for movies to be remembered long after you've seen them. Beau Travail would translate literally as ""Beautiful Work"" but I think the best translation would be ""Nice Job"" as in ""You did a nice job, here"". With the ambiguity of job meaning both work and occupation. I don't think ""Good Work"" is a proper translation like I've seen here and there."
6870,"Feel no-good movie; If you like to feel that life is unfair and unjust, if you like to know that there is no hope  you will like this film. The film shows three childhood friends which share a terrible experience in the past when one of them, Dave Boyle was abducted and abused. After twenty years, the friends are going separate ways  Jimmy is an ex-con trying to stay strait, Sean is a cop on the brink of break down and Dave is a looser. After Jimmy's daughter is murdered, the friends are brought together again. I have read Dennis Lehane's novel about a year ago and I found his narrative extremely depressing. As I was reading the book I actually could feel my serotonin levels going down. So I could not bring myself to watch the film for a long time even after the Oscars. I finally watched it on DVD and there are good and bad things about it. What I think makes me dislike the film is that the story's moral and ethical grounds are very confusing. The story shows the world in upside-down way where the ""bad guy"" is glamorised and the victim is portrayed as a very unattractive person. Whatever I think about Jimmy Markum I have to admit he is quite charismatic guy, where poor Dave Boyle just looked as if he deserved anything. In a way the film's story is similar to the ""Unforgiven"" rather than ""Shawshank redemption"". The main tag line is that you can not change anything in your life, if you are a killer, you are a killer, and if you are a victim you are a victim. The film is actually much less depressing than a book and there are even some funny dialogues in it. But I thought that some of the story lines were not very well explained. The main example is the ending. Because in the book the author actually gives the character's thoughts behind their front there is no question of where each of them stands at the end. The end is very blackand-white and in a way calling for the ""Mystic river-2"". In the film, if I have not read the book before, I would not understand what Sean's position is at the end. Also it seems that Sean's character is underdeveloped and poorly explained on a whole. The cast is what made this film worthy watching. Sean Penn did a great job, but I think that he was much deeper in the ""21 grams"". The best actor in the film for me was Tim Robbins. His portrait of David Boyle was almost out of this world. I applaud this actor when he can take on such an unattractive character and portray it with dignity. The opening scene of abduction sent chills down my spine  atmosphere was so thick you could cut it with the knife. The director/camera-man work is exceptional there. Overall  4/10"
8782,"Thunderbirds is a GOOD FAMILY movie; Thunderbirds movie was a good movie geared towards the family. My kids enjoyed the movie so much that they are telling their friends and cousins about it. We are looking forward to a sequel or two about this Tracy family - or known as the Thunderbirds. Too bad that this movie did not make the $100million mark that American movies are supposed to do but nevertheless this movie did something - they made my kids think about outer space and gave them an enjoyable and wonderful experience. The music was catchy. The one-liner ""Thunderbirds are go"" was great. Having Lady P wearing all pink was an eye opener - really a warm beautiful color. Even my husband like pink as one of his favorite color. Jonathan Frakes did a good job in directing this excellent cast. Super Ben Kingsley did a great job as villain. Bill Paxton was good as being the head and father of this super hero Tracy family. Again, we truly enjoyed this movie. We want to see a sequel happening. Plus Super actor Ben Kingsley said it, ""see you soon Jeff"" so that means there is a sequel in the works for us moviegoers who truly enjoyed this movie, and for others who missed it. We want these people who miss this movie to go out and see it. Yes, THUNDERBIRDS ARE GO for a sequel or two !!!!"
48214,"Plenty of what?; The hysterical thing about this movie is that, according to the director, it has difficulty finding a distributor in the U.S. because most of them that viewed it couldn't reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of Christianity and American angst. The thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable. Because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone ""Godspeed"" this makes it a ""Christian"" movie? One could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the ""Land of Plenty"" with all of its material excess, the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse. Plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe? Plenty of useless homeless missions? How about plenty of psycho Vietnam vets? As a pill-popping delusional survivor of agent ""pink"" are we to think America is a ""Land of Plenty"" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients? Certainly we don't have plenty of people concerned about Palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film. Of course if you worked in a German homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how Europe is the ""Continent of Plenty"" when it comes to sophistication. Indeed I agreed with the title in the end as the United States is the ""Land of Plenty"" and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts, amateur acting and dispassionately directed films. Life is too short and one, even an American, doesn't have ""plenty"" of time to waste watching this piece."
8874,"Much better than expected - in a word - Wonderful.; Ahhhh the rare and oft misunderstood zombie-comedy genre at it's absolute best. I went into this movie hoping it would be awesome but expecting it to be drivel (not familiar with the sitcom Spaced at the time) but left with a feeling a movie has not given me since... Heck I don't even remember a movie making me feel quite like this. This is what a good movie is all about. It contains everything it needs and very little it doesn't (I.E. - ""You've got red on your shirt"" - was a little overused and not that funny). While understandably the occasional scene of dismemberment and foul mouthed cursing may turn away many comedy fans, this movie was not intended for those people. This movie was intended for people who could appreciate the humor in films such as Evil Dead 2 or Dead Alive. What this movie does is escalate every good aspect of those aforementioned movies to a new degree that I feel will be difficult to surpass, launching it right up there with Monty Python and the Holy Grail as on of the best British comedic movies ever created - and quite possibly one of the best comic movies ever made regardless of nationality. While having a deep understanding of British culture helps, anyone with an IQ of over 100 should find this movie extremely entertaining. I nearly wet myself from laughing so hard throughout the movie although it does sort of drag near the end as everyone dies off, but it is miraculously saved by a heart-warming and very funny ending that couldn't have been done any better. It's upsetting that the movie didn't gross more in the states, although I'm sure once word of mouth gets around, DVD sales and rentals will pick up. I'm an extremely critical movie buff and this movie has permanently carved a notch in my top ten films of all time. If you're at all skeptical - don't be. If you're 13-60 (a very cool 60) you'll find something that will appeal to you in this movie, although I suspect its biggest fan base will be men in their 20's to early 30's. I cannot stress the importance of this film as it is now the king of all horror/comedy films. Even if the horror aspect doesn't appeal to you, the comedy is solid and if you don't find yourself laughing at least a few times throughout, then I seriously doubt you're even human. I give this the highest recommendation possible. It's a story about friendship, love, senseless violence, and gut-busting scenes of pure joy. Watch it and you'll know what mean."
30816,"Emotionally touching beyond belief...; I am a live theater person...I have enjoyed productions in L.A., New York and London. You MUST experience this on the big screen. The music and voices are heavenly, the cinematography, costumes and acting are superb. What an escape during these difficult times. It is art and culture at it's finest. This is what the big screen was created for... What touched me most was the reaction of my 13 year old daughter... Gerard Butler became the Phantom , in every way possible, believable and lovable, his performance showed a depth and wisdom way beyond his age. He touched her deeply, inspiring such overwhelming feelings of caring. Truly developing a relationship with the character. One can only hope that this movie will inspire investors and producers to give us more of the same. Of course, Christine and Raoul were devine as well, equally talented, believable and such incredible songbirds.(Oscars for their vocal coaches please.) We LOVED this movie so much. Fell in love with it really. Thank you Andrew Lloyd Webber and friends."
173115,"Atrocious; Never before has such a large cast of ugly people gathered together to make an equally ugly film. Something huge and horrifying is loose in the waters off the Florida coast, something that leaves half chewed up bodies behind in its wake. Unshaven beer dependent Bob thinks he has caught the Thing's ""evil voice"" on tape. Bob's assistant, the amazingly unattractive and painfully skinny Stella, decides to enlist the help of slimy ladies man Peter, an electrician whose equipment may be able to help them locate the mysterious creature. But anyone who sticks their nose too far into the mystery winds up dead, killed by a baboon faced hit-man with a bad perm. What is the terrible secret behind the Sea Killer? Ugly scientists have torrid affairs, inept cops and doctors puzzle over the increasing numbers of corpses, Stella and Peter make out on the beach and characters we don't care about are killed off or munched up. The Sea Killer, a weird combination of an octopus, a shark and a pair of large dentures, never really seems as threatening as it should. The conspiracy behind the monster's creation makes no sense whatsoever. None of the characters are particularly likable, and the ones who might be are killed off immediately. This is a poorly shot, badly dubbed, plot less mess. The whole thing is so scuzzy and smelly it made me long for a hot bath. I've had sushi plates scarier than this film. Avoid it, unless it's the MST3K version."
4744,"The Perfect Horror that the New century Borned!!!!; Jeepers Creepers is a movie that you may like but you may not like.Well 2000 was great year for horror movies but most of them was sequels.We needed a new beginning of a new never done before horror movie.Well,i think Jeepers Creepers is the one that we were screaming for.I don't wanna hear people who says that the horror genre is dead anymore.Here is what will you see in Jeepers Creepers.Brother and Sister are making there way back at home through a highway.Suddenly a big and strange truck horns them and they are very scared.After traveling 2-3miles more they sees the truck parked and a strange man with a costume is looking at them.But the other thing they sees is more important.They sees a bloody dead body and the man throws it through a big pipe.They are very scared and they wanna forget about everything they saw but the man with truck starts chasing them.Well you all now that it isn't a man,it is a creature but the first thoughts are that it is the typical new slasher icon but no.Well i recommend this movie to all of you horror lovers.Scary one by Victor Salva.No doubt about it."
173121,"Interesting; This really isn't such a bad little movie. The basic story is quite interesting: five teenagers on their way home from a summer festival crash their car and awaken to find themselves unharmed. However, one of them is missing, and a mysterious man in black is stalking the rest of them down one by one and seemingly killing them. What the kids don't know, but soon come to realize, is that they are lost souls, thrown from their bodies at the moment of the accident. Their physical comatose selves are in the hospital, and the two remaining survivors have only a short time left to get back into their bodies before the Angel of Death comes to claim them. A low budget, bad 80s music and an overly drawn out ending are the films only major flaws, but the acting is quite good and the story (written by star Vivian Schilling) is well thought out. Schilling went on to write a book entitled ""Quietus"" which is a sort-of sequel to this film. Worth checking out at least once, with or without the MST3K commentary."
635,"Wonderful Movie!; What a pleasant surprise this was. I caught this one day on Showtime and really didn't give it much of a chance. But I was so wrong!! Powerful performance by Irma P. Hall (as Aunt T.), and Robert Duvall is at his best as well. Wonderfully acted and written, this has to be the best movie I have seen in a long while. Sure, the same old southern stereotypes are portrayed as well as the same for the inner-city black culture, with many being quite accurate. Some parts were a little over the top, like the birthday party in the bar that Earl crashes as a total stranger. But that being said, not a lot of negatives I can say about this movie."
3300,"Not bad for a little cheapie matinée; I got into this movie ass-backwards  basically, I went to see the sequel and then had someone lend it to me to watch on DVD. Pitch Black is the first movie in the 'Chronicles of Riddick' series, and while it has nowhere near the scope or vision of its follower, is nonetheless an enjoyable film, for what it is. Part bughunt movie and part low budget sci-fi matinée, Pitch Black follows the story of a group of people stranded on a hot desert planet with three suns and only intermittent periods of darkness. Adding to the threat level is that one of the characters, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) is a prisoner, apparently a killer of some sort who cannot be trusted. One of the younger characters, Jack (Rhiana Griffith), takes a shine to him and begins imitating his every move, much to the dismay of his would-be jailer, William Johns (Cole Hauser). The group stumbles on a deserted mining colony and soon discovers there are evil nasties that only come out  you got it  after dark. When they need to make a run to an equally deserted outpost to obtain supplies to fix their damaged ship, however, that's when things get interesting. Pitch Black isn't great film-making  it's a cheaper version of an Aliens flick, let's be honest  but the rough and gritty universe is fun, and the ambivalence of Riddick is fun to watch. As darkness sets in and his special ability to see in almost total blackness comes into play, people become more reliant on his uncaring character, which adds a nice twist to an otherwise average if serviceable script and story. Much of the meat of the story revolves around Riddick, which was a smart decision. Diesel will never be considered a great thespian but he's fine here as Riddick, his basso voice and rough edges fitting into the harsh landscape and story perfectly. Keith David plays an Imam with an appropriately reverent air, and the rest of the cast all does a fine job. Pitch Black's worth a rental, if for no other reason than to cast a little more back story on Riddick so you can enjoy the top-notch sequel a but better. It's a decent enough movie in its own right, though a little cheap and a little predictable. But as cheap sci-fi goes, it's pretty good."
160412,"A Magnificent Film-Noir, The First Transposition of a Nelson Rodrigues' Play to the Big Screen; In Madureira, Rio de Janeiro, in the 60's, the powerful ""bicheiro"" (for non-Brazilians: in Brazil, mainly in Rio de Janeiro, there is an illegal and very popular lottery of numbers associated to animals called ""jogo do bicho"" (game of animals), and the outlaws are called ""bicheiros"") Boca de Ouro (Jece Valadão) dies. Two journalists look for his former lover, Dona Guigui (Odete Lara), trying to get information of any unsolved crime committed by Boca de Ouro and make a bang news. In accordance with her mood, Guigui tells three different versions of the mysterious murder of Leleco (Daniel Filho) and Celeste (Maria Lúcia Monteiro) to the reporters. ""Boca de Ouro"" was the first transposition to the screen of a successful play of Nelson Rodrigues, one of my favorite Brazilian writers. The story is indeed a film-noir, very amoral, as a trademark of Nelson Rodrigues, slightly recalling the storyline of ""Rashômon"" (the same event told in different versions) and directed by one of the best Brazilian directors, Nelson Pereira dos Santos. Jece Valadão is perfect in the role of an ambitious gangster, who replaces his perfect teeth by gold, and aimed to be buried in a golden coffin. I regret that this magnificent film has not had a decent distribution. My VHS, horribly recorded in LP, was released by ""Isto É"", and the image does not stop scrolling. There are only fifteen votes in IMDb, meaning that there is no worldwide distribution of this movie. I feel sorry for the overseas movie lovers, not having the chance to know such a great unknown film. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): ""Boca de Ouro"" (""Golden Mouth"")"
8907,good; I actually went to see this when I was on holiday in Lyon and unfortunately it was in French so I didn't understand the majority of it. My French teacher suggested that I should see it to improve my French. So basically there's not much point in you reading this comment anyway. But still.. I did think that it was better than Finding Nemo. It has a much better story-line and I did laugh out loud at some of the things. My favourite character was the vegetarian shark :) If you liked Finding Nemo then you'll probably enjoy Shark Tale. Even though the plot is different they are the same kind of idea. Animated sea creatures.. quite sweet really. It's an excellent family film.
172961,"Dull and Moronic; In the untouched primordial swamplands of rural Arkansas lurks a giant creature, 8 feet tall and covered with hair. It's either Slash, Rob Zombie or Bigfoot. No one is sure, for those who have seen it are not believed or have not lived to tell the tale. That doesn't stop smarmy Professor Lockhart from taking a couple of his prize students and a whiny girl with a bad perm down into the swamps to look for the monster. This movie reeks like an outhouse in high summer...and, in fact, features an outhouse scene that we could all do without. The hillbilly's look frighteningly like the real thing and are a lot scarier than the Boggy Creek Creature. Cindy Butler whines and screams her way through the entire film, making you wish that Boggy would rip her head off. Charles Pierce as Lockhart is so annoyingly smug and condescending you'll be wishing he'd run afoul of the Deliverance cast. Serene Hedin as Tanya must have been wondering what the hell happened, going from the beautiful film ""Windwalker"" to this dung heap. Poorly acted, badly lit and simply boring. Stick with the MST3K version of this film."
8043,"A Different Kind of Horror Film; The Leary family, John (Danny DeVito), Jack (Robert J. Steinmiller, Jr.) and Dylan (Miko Hughes), have moved from Syracuse, New York to Oakland, California in the early 1970s. John was a children's show host in Syracuse, but also has a love for horror films, and becomes a television horror film host in Oakland. On one level, the film is just a drama about the Leary's trying to settle into their new life. On another level, Jack The Bear is about confronting various kinds of monsters, from make-believe to human, as well as more abstract ""monsters"", including behaviors that are difficult to control and accidental tragedies such as deaths. I've seen Jack The Bear a few times now, and every time I see it I like it even better. The performances are fantastic, taking you on a roller coaster of emotions. But it almost requires multiple viewings to really ""get"" the film. At its heart is the growing presence and threat of the various ""monsters"" mentioned above. The various monsters are all woven together in very complex ways, and most of the developments later on in the film are about how those monsters can be conquered, but always at some price. Just as the threads are densely combined, so is the vanquishing of the monsters, and both the development of the monsters and the ""solutions"" to them are like various pieces of a large jigsaw puzzle, each piece necessary for the whole, and often affecting the whole in unexpected ways. The direction, script, editing, cinematography, and all of the technical aspects are impeccable. The score is also wonderful and not only enhances the setting, but underscores the dramatic developments if you listen to the lyrics closely. A 10 out of 10 from me. Don't miss this film."
543,"This may be Mike Myers funniest movie EVER!; For a first (and I know it's not his absolute first but close to it) this movie was fantastic. The more I watched, the funnier it got and the best are the small nuances. After following his work and being a fan of his other films I appreciate the humour he's written into this movie even more. If there's any doubt that this is a masterpiece, bring up the scene where he visits his parents in any crowd and watch the quotables start flying. When asked what my favorite movie of all time is (a supremely tough question for a movie buff) this one always pops out first. It's cute, smart, hilarious, and no body gets hurt! Watch it! Love it!"
6746,"Best when we're mired in rednecks; Fly Creek is a small southern town best known for it's ""antiques"" and the Grimes Worm Farm. During one particularly hot summer, while Mick (Don Scardino) is on his way on a bus to meet new girlfriend Geri Sanders (Patricia Pearcy), they're hit by a whopper of a thunderstorm. Fly Creek's roads are flooded and they've lost power due to a downed power line that is still sparking. And that leads to a big problem. Because when the film's worms are stimulated by electricity, they come out of the ground, ready to bite, and there are millions of them! As is obvious from the premise, Squirm is a nature-gone-wild film, a subgenre of horror that was particularly active in the 70s. It's a pretty good example of the genre, and the film is successful more often than not, as long as you don't start to question the plot too much. Overall, it's a 7 out of 10 for me. I almost gave it an 8, but the ending is a bit too clichéd, so I knocked off a point. I've only seen one of director/writer Jeff Lieberman's other films so far--Blue Sunshine (1976)--and that also had points taken off for a less-than-satisfying ending. Squirm is at its best when it's wallowing in small redneck town weirdness. The Sheriff (Peter MacLean) is frighteningly unresponsive, a bit pleasantly campy, and he's also a paranoid troublemaker. The Grimes family, Willie (Carl Dagenhart) and Roger (R.A. Dow), are demented and creepy. The Sanders family seems oddly dysfunctional, and Geri's sister, Alma (Fran Higgins), demonstrates that Juliette Lewis wasn't the first Juliette Lewis. When all of this stuff is combined with Squirm's initial slow-burning horror aspects--including a relatively subtle amount of worms and a well-placed (both literally and in terms of the script) skeleton--it is good, almost sublimely so. But things begin to go slightly awry when we get to the big extravaganza near the end. The characters have either died off or Lieberman simply abandons them. Having a lot of characters die off by the end is understandable and even laudable in a film like this, but it's too bad we couldn't have seen them longer and had more emotional investment in them. Simply abandoning characters isn't as excusable. Of course the attacking worm quotient increases as the film continues, and this is handled well physically (I can't imagine having to be a worm wrangler), but plot points surrounding the worms become sketchier and almost contradictory at times. That saps too much tension out of the ending, and instead we're primarily engaged by physical effects for their own sake, plus a wonderfully campy change in personality from Roger. Squirm is definitely worth seeing for anyone with a taste for lower-budget 1970s horror, and at times is quite a gem. Just don't set your expectations too high (but really, who would for a film like this?)"
148408,"Larry Buchanan needs a budget, an editor and some scriptwriters; A genetic problem on Mars has decreased their female population so that there is only 1 female born to every 100 males. They believe that they can solve their problems by acquiring a few choice females from the Earth, for scientific study experimentation, and they're prepared to get the women whether they receive cooperation or not. If properly fleshed out, the premise could have promise. But it's not fleshed out, and Mars Needs Women is loaded with problems. The plot as it stands makes very little logical sense. Not that this is a completely unwatchable film--it has many ""so bad it's good"" qualities, and my final score was a 6 out of 10. Another problem is that the film seems extremely low budget. They barely even built any sets. Quite a few shots are just a couple of characters talking, framed tightly, against a solid-color backdrop. Most of the ""fancier"" shots, such as those of military aircraft flying and landing, are stock footage. The film is also full of padding--the stock footage goes on far longer than it should have. There is a scene that seems to go on forever where we just see a loudspeaker and listen to mostly unintelligible ""military radio"" banter. There is a striptease scene (apparently strippers are one of the prime candidates for the kind of women that Mars needs) that goes on for minutes and minutes with the stripper taking nothing off. The Martians are just like humans for the most part, sparing the trouble of expensive make-up and sparing having to explain why Earth women would work for the task at hand. The Martian costumes are just shiny material with something like bathing caps on their heads and big headphone cups on their ears (this aspect is somewhat reminiscent of My Favorite Martian, and was even echoed in later material like Mork & Mindy, but in Mars Needs Women it doesn't have the intentional humor). So why did I give this film a rating as high as 6 out of 10? Well, believe it or not, a few aspects of the film work as they were intended to. The whole sequence of the two Martians at the hotel, acquiring a press badge and so forth, was actually engaging and not really unintentionally funny. But most of the film is unintentionally funny, and most of it works on that level, too. You can laugh at the bad decisions made due to budget. You can laugh at the pacing. You can laugh at the hammy dialogue. You can laugh at how the Martians pick their women. And most of all, the more you spend time analyzing the ridiculous plot, the more you'll laugh."
3137,"Formulaic laziness; A few contributors have suggested that they don't make 'em like this any more. Fair enough - but did they ever? It's as if a studio executive sat down and figured that people d'un certain age' would flock to see this, containing as it does a bumper load of superannuated matinée idols engaging in a romping tale of derring do. Roger Moore meanwhile is recruited to, well, be Roger Moore and provide the romantic interest. This couldn't have been a cheap film to make, so its gaping lack of period authenticity is striking. The universal absence of 1940s haircuts among the cast simply reinforces the impression of formulaic laziness that this movie exudes from every pore. And we can only wonder what possessed great actors like David Niven, Trevor Howerd and Gregory Peck to get mixed up in this dog's breakfast. If this shows up in your TV schedules, get down to the video store and rent one of 'A Matter of Life and Death', 'Brief Encounter' or absolutely anything else with Gregory Peck in it."
30894,"Nice try but must work harder!; WHITE NOISE (d. Geoffrey Sax, 2004, Canada) SPOILER ALERT I can't be the only one who longs for the days when The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits were producing hour, or even 30 minute, tales that gave the audience an other-worldly concept, threw in Job Public and set about creeping you out sufficiently that whether it was the paranormal, a crazed killer or a dystopian future, you took it to bed that night. Listening to actual Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP) recordings is certainly spooky but the only scary thing to take home from Geoffrey Sax's White Noise is the dread that it probably won't be too long before there's another lame attempt to strap a spooky little tale to the rack and stretch it into a movie length script which gives up the ghost half way through. After 98 minutes it's difficult to say which is the more stupid past-time - staring at a static television picture or watching Michael Keaton's gormless features trying to persuade us that he actually believes his wife is sending him images from the future. Judging by how little emotion Keaton exudes toward his second wife (Chandra West) it's hardly surprising that an attempt to cover up their lack of chemistry is tackled by letting us in on the secret that she's pregnant. Cue flower and chocolate; purchases we know will never be received. This is the kind of dot-to-dot movie-making where a surname like Rivers means you'll end up drowned at some point so when the corpse of Anna Rivers is found in a watery grave the Police don't push Keaton's husband too much into providing an alibi. The plaid-wearing Brit expert on EVP (Ian McNeice as Raymond Price) is a warmer touch than the underground geek often served up in these roles, and serves perhaps as a reference point to Raymond Cass the Yorkshire man who spent much of his life progressing real research into EVP. Right from the opening credits, that seductively slink our gaze around a radio speaker, Sax uses the medium of film to layer on us the scope of voices and messages that wend their way through the airwaves. But, as the film progresses, it left me wondering why, if the spirit world has the power to repeatedly turn on a radio and stop a clock at 2.30 (am or pm - they don't seem to care), why can't it just write down the directions to a killer? That the killer turns out to be a trio of black shadows and one lumber jack shirt clad site worker (who we met earlier in case weren't quite sure how he fitted into the Rivers' world vision) doesn't end the movie with any kind of message about the power of EVP. Rather, the makers seem to have bottled it on the notion that EVP alone is interesting enough for a creepy story premise and so added three ghosts and one heavy to satisfy everyone's theory on the murders. And sadly, the sight of Keaton disco dancing via spirit world puppet masters cracking his bones is going to leave me smiling rather than cowering. By the end the writer has got so lazy that he's forgotten the premise hammered home earlier that EVP messages only appear during playback of recorded tapes. Keaton's voice shuffles onto a car stereo post-funeral, to apologise to his son. It's a moment that reminds you that poor little Mikey Rivers has been neglected throughout White Noise almost as much as a coherent plot. Batted from father to mother and stepmother the kid's now got to move in with his mother and new lover for keepsif he's not there simply as yet another 'standard' of this genre then I'll host my own posthumous radio show. If only there has been some subliminal static interference during the movie to apologise to the audience for what had just been served up."
8784,"Phantasmagorical; I was at my friend's house, and she had rented Garden State, so I got really excited, because it looked really good. And compared to Napoleon Dynamite, which we also watched, it was a better indie film by a long shot. RATINGS: Direction-fabulous!!!!! Gives a good impression of how people feel when they are on drugs.--kudos for Zach Braff Acting-Natalie Portman did a great job. Sam reminded me of myself...in that she said a lot of stupid things and never stopped talking. I had never seen Zach Braff before, and his performance was amazing. more kudos for Zach braff Script: Very well written. kudos keep coming Overall-Watch it, but not with your children. Also, the music is awesome!"
4886,"One of the most endearing animation films created; Pixar is the best! Of them all, Monsters, Inc. takes the cake. The realism of the characters' movements & feelings is perfect. The ending is a tear jerker on a happy note. At first I was concerned with the plot of monsters scaring children with a ""business as usual"" attitude, but right away you discover that the monsters are as terrified of the kids as the kids are of monsters.... wonderful juxtaposition throughout the film... a totally enjoyable, feel-good story. Buy it for the kids and let them watch it over and over. (adults may want to sit-in on more than one occasion themselves). Personal Note: For me, a mystery about this film was ""Roz""; the voice reminded me so strongly of the grandmother in ""Dinosaurs"", and I thought the character drawing was similar as well; upon researching the two, I found they are definitely different actors."
178103,"Aaaaaaargh!; Nine out of nine people who watched this have declared themselves to be mentally scarred for life. No-one should ever have to see this abomination. The English Language is poorly equipped to express how utterly, dreadfully atrocious this ""film"" is. It's really not worth the plastic it's made of. No greater crime has been committed by the human race in the entire history of creation; never is there likely to be anything worse. It was agreed unanimously that the scene involving the shrunken head of Tommy and the young girl's blouse was unbelievably sick and twisted; in fact many of us have not yet recovered from the ordeal and are currently sitting in the corner of the room rocking, sucking our thumbs and whimpering. The fundamental question on everyone's lips, however, has to be ""Why???"". How is it possible for anyone to create such a monstrosity and then subject it to so many innocent people? After viewing the trailer we thought that this film might be a laugh: how wrong we were. Please sign the petition to rid the world of ""Shrunken Heads"" so that no other poor civilians be exposed to it. Please, for the good of humanity."
8833,"Thackeray with a hint of Indian spice; This latest literary adaptation definitely makes the grade - scripted by Julian Fellowes (after 'Gosford Park' he's fast becoming a rival to Andrew Davies for this kind of thing), and directed by Mira Nair with a heavy Bollywood influence. Reece Witherspoon - another American playing an English role! - does well as Becky Sharp, a character of contradictions who shamelessly climbs up the social ladder but has a soft centre (cleverly hidden). She's supported by an interesting array of English actors - James Purefoy (excellent as weak-willed gambler Rawdon), Douglas Hodge, Eileen Atkins, Bob Hoskins, Jim Broadbent (who seems to be in every English film made), Jonathan Rhys-Meyer, Geraldine MacEwan, Deborah Findlay, and Barbara Leigh-Hunt. High up in the cast are actors from other places too - Rhys Ifan is Dobbin (surprisingly good if all you've seen him in is 'Notting Hill'), and Gabriel Byrne fails to grasp an English accent but is otherwise memorable as the dissolute Marquis of Steyne. 'Vanity Fair' being a brick of a book which is hard to get through, this film version will do much to bring out the relevance of Thackeray's clever text and put it in the 21st century. Although the settings and costumes are early 19th century as they should be, the Indian influence - excused because of Jos Sedley's residence out east - livens up the piece and gives it new focus."
8784,"One of the best indie movies ever; This is one of the very few movies that related to me. It was beautifully written, directed, and acted by Zach Braff. Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Jean Smart (just to name a few) did an excellent job of making this movie more than I ever expected. This movie made all these emotions come out of me. It made me think more about what's expected of us. The best part about this entire production, however, was the soundtrack. It is now my favorite album. It's like the emo kids best friend. Includes awesome bands like The Shins; Iron and Wine,who do a marvelous acoustic cover of The Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights""; Frou Frou; and Coldplay. This movie is one to watch."
30816,"Wonderful; I'm not sure I'm guna have enough for 10 lines as this is just guna be an honest reaction to the film. I'v seen the stage show and I thought this topped it. It can go places and show things that a stage production can not. I can't say much more without giving anything away for those who have not seen it. It allows for a much deeper insight into the characters. All the cast were amazing from the scene stealing Minnie Driver to the soulful performance of Gerard Butler, he had me in tears! and I don't normally cry at movies. In short, this is one of the best movies I'v seen in a long time. Unfortunately I'v got a feeling it will be overlooked at the awards because of Chicago, the injustice!"
30812,"boring; My wife thought it would be a treat to go see The Aviator as I am a private pilot. I knew it was about Howard Hughs. What a boring load of tosh, it was like watching paint dry. The flying scenes are pathetic. After a miserable 1 hour 10 Min's I could stand it no longer and left before the end. I would love to get my money back. Others around me were groaning and fidgeting in their seats, a sure sign that others felt the same. I'm sure that people left after we made our escape. Sorry, no redeeming features at all, the worst film I have seen in a long time."
6711,"An 8 ?, #166 ? Oscar ?, Are we desperate for something new?; You hate to think it isn't talent. Maybe it's not inherited, but talent anyway. Not just another spoiled Hollywood brat? Could that be? But then it is very good for your JC film project. Isn't it? It is apparent she has spent a lot of time in 5 star hotels, billion dollar offices and tourist shops. Maybe she should get out sometime and see a bit more of ""Asia"". Well worth watching though. A better than good first try and with Bill Murray, well what can you say? With Scarlett Johansson, the off beat is apparently her style and with this and Pearl ?, well can she do it again?"
6173,"heart-warming mythology; This small-scale film focuses on Gypsy folklore and myth, reincarnation, nature, and childhood. Early in the film two Irish boys are given a horse by their grandad, which they decide to keep hidden in their tenement flat. Their father is severely depressed after the death of his wife, and lets the boys run riot. When the children (and horse) go on the run, he comes to terms with his travelling past with the Gypsies again and seeks solace in their help, wisdom, and faith. 'Into the West' is a truly remarkable film. The actors playing the children are remarkable (especially Ciaran Fitzgerald as Ossie), while the adult cast are headed by Gabriel Byrne (as the former traveller father) and his then-wife Ellen Barkin (as the mystical gypsy Kathleen). Both are excellent, while the mystical thread of the story - against the odds - remains believable and leaves an ending of optimism and goodwill. Mike Newell, the director, and Jim Sheridan, the writer, deserve high praise for this movie. I also need to mention the Celtic music which pushes the story along and does much to set the atmosphere. Superb."
7392,"Stewart steals the show; Having paid my debt to the library, I was once again able to rent DVDs from them, and I got right back into the swing of things with this western from 1968. I like westerns as much as the next guy, but honestly, I checked it out because it was a Raquel Welch film, and like most of her oeuvre, it's basically harmless but hardly ever aspires to be anything other than mildly satisfying. There's some odd casting in Bandolero; Dean Martin (!!) plays Dee Bishop, a ne'er do well, and Jimmy Stewart (!!) plays his brother Mace (what is this, Star Wars?), a slightly more noble ne'er do well. Will Geer  best known as Grandpa on the Waltons  is along for the ride as a cantankerous old outlaw named Pops, and George Kennedy rounds out the cast as the simple but good-hearted sheriff with a name far better than the rest of the film, July Johnson. Lastly of course, we have Welch (note how I avoided using the 'rounding out' joke on her?), who plays Maria Stoner, a Mexican ex-whore who has married a rich man and is his trophy wife (shades of Anna Nicole Smith). When Dee kills Stoner in the first reel, Maria is left all alone, and is taken hostage by Dee after his narrow escape from the gallows. The plot is fairly straightforward; the sheriff loves the woman who will have nothing to do with him, and he tracks her all over God's brown earth (i.e., Mexico) to get her back. Inexplicably she falls in love with her husband's murderer (Raquel falling for Dean Martin? That's like Natalie Portman falling for Patrick Dempsey. Come on) as they travel deeper into bandito country. As we get to know the characters we find that pretty much everyone other than Dee and his brother in the outlaw gang is a rotten apple (which is such a shock, seeing as how they are bank robbers), and only Mace really has any couth at all. Martin, ostensibly the star, is okay here. I never considered him much of an actor, but he's serviceable here. Welch is okay; mostly she has to look good, which isn't hard for her (her hair and nails are always impeccable). I liked Will Geer's world-weary sarcasm and venality, mostly because it was such a change from Grandpa. And Kennedy tries his best to be a likable simpleton, playing everything straight and honest; July's a good guy, but there's not enough to him to tug much at our sympathies. The big surprise is Stewart, who doesn't really seem right for the role of an aging desperado; but his insistence on playing it just less than serious is terrific, and most of his scenes right up until the end are highly amusing. In fact he and Martin have surprising comedic chemistry, and several of their scenes play as asides, everyone stopping what they are doing to listen to the two brothers riff. Stewart imbues the film with some much-needed humor, and steals the show at the same time. Bandolero isn't remembered as a classic, with good reason, but it isn't a bad film. It would be forgettable if not for Stewart, but with his comedic licks it rises to be a moderately engaging comedy. There are scores of better westerns, and even better Welch films (and many better Stewart films), but overall, for an evening's diversion, you could do much, much worse."
8977,"Stone goes so far, but not all the way.; ""Stay with me tonight, Hephaistion"". And with that line you know where you're at, and while Oliver Stone's epic never gets down and dirty with any boy-on-boy action, (long, lingering looks, a lot of bear-hugs and a kiss planted firmly on the lips of a luscious male slave is as hot as it gets), this is, nevertheless, a remarkably frank depiction of homosexuality, or at least bisexuality, for a mainstream studio epic. It's in that lack of boy-on-boy action that Stone fudges things; having gone so far as he does, you just wish he would have gone the extra mile. Did he really think that as it stands this would really play in Middle America? Or maybe by pulling the plug on the sex and concentrating on the violence he thought they just wouldn't get it? Still, it's certainly not the turkey I had been lead to believe. Stone draws parallels between Alexander's campaign in Persia and what is happening in Iraq. Alexander's empire could be seen as a thinly disguised America with a similar record in botched foreign policy. His heart may have been in the right place but massacring the natives wasn't going to win him many friends abroad. Not without it's little absurdities, (as if to compensate for Colin Farrel's Irish brogue, Stone populates the film with other Irish actors and even has Val Kilmer coming over all Oirish as his father), it is still an intelligent and potent piece of cinema. While it's two battle scenes are brilliantly choreographed it's essentially a talkative epic and clocking in at almost three hours is never boring. Farrel is surprisingly effective in the title role, Irish accent and all, and Angelina Jolie redeems her recent spate of mediocre performances with a nice turn as his mother. Unfortunately Anthony Hopkins as an ancient Ptolemy comes over too much like Richard Attenborough and none of the rest of a large cast are given enough screen time to make any kind of impression. But it's still well worth seeing and may well turn out to be the most undeservedly over-looked film of the year."
2133,"Charming; For an unknown (to me) reason, when I saw this on British TV, it was called ""A Night On The Town"", a far inferior title than 'Adventures in Babysitting', although maybe they figured that parents would think this a children's movie... Anyway, the movie itself is charming in that way that only 1980s US comedy films are. There is an air of innocence to the whole thing, before these more conscious and overtly cynical days that we know and hate now - maybe a reason why 1980s retro is all the rage now... that, and things are cyclical. I thought the film WAS charming, although entirely far-fetched in its plot lines, although I think that was kind of the point. The characters, while not being very complicated, were warm and at least not entirely two-dimensional, and the little girl was quite cute and not extremely annoying as could have happened. Overall, I'd recommend it to hounds who love to watch 80s films."
8641,"Not so funny movie appeals mainly to males under 30.; Many critics gave 'Anchorman' good marks, but we watched it last night on DVD and couldn't believe how bad it is. It is clearly aimed at broad comedy but most of the situations, dialog and acting simply were embarrassing to watch. Will Ferrell who plays the fictional 1970s title character, anchorman Ron Burgundy, has been funny in many skits I have seen him in, especially on SNL, where other people wrote for him. As I watched him here, I had the feeling he was trying to be another Steve Martin, but just came across as foolish, and not funny. One of the worst was the conversation he was having in the newsroom with Christina Applegate who plays the new reporter Veronica Corningstone. We see something poking out inside his pants, and Veronica mentions to him that he has a very large erection, and he promptly parades around the newsroom with this ""erection"" prominently displayed. That MIGHT have seemed funny on paper, and high school boys watching the movie MIGHT have laughed at it, but the three of us watching the movie just though it was stupid. There are many other scenes that shot for a comedic reaction but just didn't work for us. Fred Willard playing the boss Ed Harken was the only ray of light here. Willard is always funny, and he underplays his role quite appropriately. He is bringing in the dreaded 'woman' on the news team, and the guys don't like it one bit. Burgundy feels threatened, but is immediately smitten when he meets Victoria. Against all reason, she also falls for the dopey and incompetent Burgundy, and they have what seems to be an attempt at a comedic bedroom scene but just seemed absurd to us. When Burgundy has an altercation on the freeway and is then late for the evening news broadcast, Veronica steps in and does great, fulfilling her dream to become an on-air anchor. Later there is a very silly scene at the zoo, covering the birth of a new Panda, when various news team members end up in a bear pit. There is a silly scene of four rival news teams fighting in an alley, 'West Side Story' style, but one man played by Luke Wilson in a 'cameo' gets his arm cut off and we see the nub but he just looks at it and shrugs. Later, at the zoo, his other arm is cut off. The very best rating I can give this movie is a ""3"", and only because I have seen some even worse movies I rate ""1"" or ""2"". I cannot imagine how well-known critics can give it a favorable rating. I don't really care about Will Farrell, but I love Christina Applegate as an actress. Her role here was a waste of her talent. I hope she picks better projects in the future. Can you tell I was totally disappointed in this movie??"
3160,"Magnolia; Magnolia is a study of true humanity. Everyone in the story lives in a ""sh*t bag"" and knows it and does nothing about it except the one moral center who is the policeman. He is trying to better himself in a sliding world. (John C. Reilly) This is odd because he actually sees on a daily basis what the world has to offer and should be the most dispirited. The weak people though are the least likely ones, the ones most cared for should be the strongest but are the most depraved, which is true to life all around us. This is not, as the site suggests, a story about friends and weather but about life and human emotion, capacity, depravity and need at its truest levels. I have seen most of PT Anderson's movies and this seems to be his style and he does it better than anyone. His movies, if you are open to the truth, are more than amazing."
5611,"Good ""romantic"" story in limited time...; I love this film. It is better than the previous movie version. Heath Ledger does a good job of moving between emotions: love, fear, desperation, honor, courage, anger, loyalty, hopelessness and peace. Kate Hudson, who is not one of my favorite actresses, did a good job of moving her character along the emotional avenue from resentment against Harry to guilt at having failed him. She did this with remarkably little screen time. The movie had myriad themes: Western arrogance, cultural disparity, honor and dishonor. It thought it took the book's themes and gave them a modern twist."
5592,"cutesy movie with a bad monster but little violence; This was sort of a cute movie, nothing too great. It starts off with a pre-credits sequence of people getting dragged into their closets, or walking into their closets, only to be attacked by something. We don't see the attack, since the camera takes a side view of the open closet door, and we hear screaming and cartoonish monster eating noises, as clothing is tossed out of the closet. John Carradine has a small role as one of these people, and blind man violently smashing his cane around his apartment looking for his guide dog (who the monster hung on the closet door). We then meet a reporter who looks a lot like Superman's alter-ego Clark Kent, complete with big black-rimmed Clark Kent eyeglasses. He's named Richard Clark. He got his job at the paper through nepotism, and only does obituaries, but her wants something more. The lead reporter ""Scoop"" gives him a three-week old story about the people dying in their closets as a laugh. Clark befriends a young boy at the police station while waiting to talk to the chief there. The boy is a bespectacled small version of himself, perhaps. He's doing some kind of experiment recording all different kinds of sounds, while his mother - a teacher at the local college, where some of the deaths occurred - talks to the chief, explaining how the bite marks found on the victims are somewhat consistent with snake bites. Clark angers the bespectacled mother by having let the boy have a chocolate bar. Everyone, including the mother, calls the boy ""The Professor."" Clark also meets an Albert Einstein-looking Nobel Priza-winning professor at the college, and gives him a claw he found at one of the crime scenes. We also see that the mother becomes speechlessly, motionlessly smitten with Clark every time he takes his glasses off. They soon see the monster, who starts coming out of closets. There are elements of ""Alien"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" to the monster and their attempts to communicate with it. This movie could be appropriate for children, although be forewarned that there is a brief topless scene. A bit surprising for a PG-rated movie, but not altogether without precedent. Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend (1985) had a lot more. The scene it occurs in is one early in the movie, and comically spoofs the shower scene in Hitchcock's Psycho."
7254,"One of the best movies i saw in 2004; For a Start Aston Kutcher does a surprisingly good job in this role, easily his best film to date (although that alone is not really a good reason to watch this) As with all movies that play with the notion of altering time, there are plot holes (and some of them are big - e.g. why are his journal entries always the same, regardless of what he has changed?) If you can get passed these plot holes, and view this film without trying to find them and just go with it, you'll find a massively enjoyable film. As you may all already be aware, there are two versions of the film (well the Ending) and they both have completely different appeal, for me the directors ending is superior, it is more unexpected and far more shocking, but it does end the film on a slight downer, which is why the original release was happier (even though it didn't really fit the film) Definitely worth watching Original Release 6/10 Directors cut 8/10"
8977,"Could sink like a Stone; I had awaited this movie eagerly: the story of a man who conquered most of the known world by the time he was 25 is truly epic; I have recently read one of the many new biographies of the Macedonian warrior; in his time, director Oliver Stone has produced some fine work; and here he has spent no less than $150M, making it Europe's most costly film. One could not fail to be aware of the panning given the work by the critics, but I figured that it really couldn't be that bad. But, believe me, it is. ""Gladiator"" showed what an epic should look like and ""Troy"" was a good effort, but Stone - who, at his best, has given us such impressive work as ""Salvador"", ""Platoon"" and ""Wall Street"" - will be fortunate to survive this plodding and pedestrian debacle. The first hour is utterly tedious and one cries out for the sort of battle sequence which opened ""Gladiator"" while, towards, the sprawling end, we seem to be revisiting the manic ending of ""Apocalyse Now"" without Brando's style. So, when did it go wrong? Well, seemingly at every stage of the production process. First, Stone - and his producer Moritz Borman - rushed the whole thing in order to beat a rival production (now unlikely to reach the screen) planned by Australian director Baz Luhrmann. Then the script - co-authored by Stone himself - overdoes the theme of Alexander's bi-sexuality which is death at the US box office and becomes somewhat histrionic for the rest of the world. Some of the casting is odd - most notably the choice of Angelina Jolie (only one year older than Colin Farrell in the eponymous role) to play Alexander's mother. Next we have the appalling decision to have most of the lead actors deploy incongruous Irish accents just because lead Colin Farrell (who can do other accents) hails from the emerald isle. The whole structure is a disaster with a boring, and largely redundant, narration, confusing flashbacks, and a total bum-numbing, mind-bending length of just under three hours. Finally the editing is all wrong, as Stone made three major cuts to slice away close to an hour, but slashed too little and disjointedly. The essence of cinema is storytelling and this work utterly lacks a compelling narrative which, given the heroic feats and complex character of the man, is a special kind of achievement. Surely the film has some redeeming features? Well, the two battle sequences - the defeat of Darius and his superior forces at Gaugamela and the encounter with Indians and elephants at Hydaspes in India - are genuinely large-scale and exciting, although it is difficult to follow Alexander's tactics. The Moroccan and Thailand locations are exotic, the richly-designed sets are grand and the CGI creations, especially of the glory of Babylon, are well done. The attention to historic and military detail is commendable and thanks to Oxford academic Robin Lane Fox who gets to lead the battle charges as a reward. Angelina Jolie has the best accent (not Irish) and gives the best performance. But this is far from enough to justify the price of a theatre ticket. Can the work be rescued for the DVD or is it destined to sink like Stone? Often the DVD offers us a longer version of the movie, but this time we need a shorter, reordered account with a linear narrative, less talk and much more action."
30749,"An important movie; Everybody should see this movie and even more our leaders. And they should feel ashame that they didn't act when the genocide was going on in 1994. And 10 years later, it's sad to say that lessons haven't been learned, even if a lot of good words have been said. Just look at what's going on in Darfur. Contrary to most people, I don't think Don Cheadle gave an Oscar winning performance. It's sometimes uneven. But Sophie Okonedo was just great. As for Nick Nolte, it was hard for me to really like him, because I was just thinking of General Roméo Dallaire, the true hero who was leading the incapacitated U.N. team. But forget about the acting, the story is too important to pay too much attention to performances. It's a heart wrenching film, with some rays of hope. There's some very moving scenes like the one where all the foreigners are leaving the hotel by bus. SEE IT! What more can I say? Seen at the Varsity, in Toronto, on January 15th, 2004. 86/100 (***½)"
26242,A directorial classic; For any young wannabe director this film should serve as the ideal tutorial. For starters so low was its budget that there was no room for the use of any fancy special effects or big name actors. Instead we have none other than Dennis Weaver pretty much carrying the film single-handedly. Although that is not even half the story because as already alluded to this film is all about the direction. The camera work is so so good that what is just a dirty old truck is thoroughly convincingly portrayed as an evil beast. Incidentally making out the truck to be the enemy as opposed to its driver is just another example of Spielberg's innovatively clever direction. From a personal point of view the use of the car radio to alert the audience to David's mood was very simple but no less effective. There are of course many more examples of the quality of the direction which won't be mentioned here for the sake of conciseness. Weaver of course deserves a mention for his emotional performance but all the plaudits must go to Spielberg for creating this tense edge of your seat thriller. An absolute masterpiece. 10/10
1413,"Most Underrated Film of the Last 20 Years, at least; I saw this film at the theater - with, I think five other people. I was the only male human in the crowd, the rest were middle-aged women, no doubt ""chick flick"" fans. Not what I expected... I had assumed that I'd have to carve a path through the Corsairs before claiming my seat! The smell of death was all around, the floor slippery with the blood of those slain in battle... Oops, got ahead of myself. I'm a big fan of Robert E. Howard's work, especially Conan (though Solomon Kane is a great character as well). His personal ""weirdness"" is well-documented, etc., etc. The film pulls no punches about it at all... This is a film for writers - especially ""new"" writers who ""need"" to learn the history of American heroic fiction - because the Weird Tales days represented the pinnacle of that genre. It's also a film for high school English teachers; I'd make it mandatory. The reason is that REH's contributions to the body of American literature is genuinely important. Without his successes (he made money off his writing), I suspect August Derleth wouldn't have been as successful at publishing and thus Ray Bradbury wouldn't have been as successful as he is. Everyone: watch this film, study this film, seek out Robert E. Howard's books. If you are unfamiliar with the GREAT writing Howard, Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, et al, this film will introduce the early 1930's pulp writer's world to you... As Robert E. Howard, Vince D'Onfrio gives what I think is his absolute best performance. What he's doing in Law & Order: CI, or whatever supporting roles he gets (MIB, etc.), and his future roles, are never going to be this good. In fact, a lot of them aren't worth bothering with at all (e.g., The Cell). It's also the only movie with Renee Zellweger worth watching (OK, Jerry Maguire's good). Yeah, hers is the main character, but she's perfectly cast, rather than (hey, I'm entitled to my opinion) the astonishingly successful mis-casting her as a vamp in anything... MINOR SPOILERS Best scene: we see Robert E. Howard typing out a story - and he's yelling out the action at the typewriter. Disappointment: H.P. Lovecraft is mentioned in one scene, but I wish they had another scene regarding the letter-writing relationship between HPL and REH, among others. I wrote to L. Sprague De Camp (who was alive in 1996) about this film (De Camp owned the rights to all things REH and is responsible for REH's being hoisted out of obscurity 40 or so years ago) and about Kull (ugh) - another REH-created film. He sent me back an autographed picture!"
66152,Interesting film that entertains.; TerrorVision (1986) was one of those movies that made the rounds on pay t.v. and cable during the mid to late 80's. The movie was also very popular on video for awhile as well. An entertaining film that does it's job. Nothing horrible or bad about this movie but it's no great shakes either. A young boy and his shell shock grandfather discover something horrible that is threatening the existence of the household and the Earth as well. A watchable movie. I wouldn't go out of my way to find a copy but if it comes on t.v. I would give it a try. Mildly recommended. xxx
30822,very good; Excellent feel good movie. Interesting look at how being young can affect a workplace and how young people are not always the greatest leaders in the workplace. All the actors were great in it especially Topher who was very believable in his role. The funniest part was when he invites himself over for dinner at Dennis Quaid's house. I thought some of the subplots were pretty stupid and unnecessary as it did nothing for the film or any of the characters. It just made the main character more vulnerable as he had more family responsibilities. I would have liked there to have been a more happy ending too it but I guess you could say it was kind of happy cause everyone made closure with one another in the end.
4625,"The worst movie of all time; ""Millennium"" is beyond a doubt the worst feature film ever made;it is so mind-numbingly horrible it makes ""Heaven's Gate"" look like ""Citizen Kane"". What makes me it hate it so much?Let me count the ways: 1)A plot so incredibly convoluted even the CIA couldn't decode it; 2)John Varley's script and direction--or should I say lack thereof; 3)A soundtrack guaranteed to make the strongest of men wince in agony; 4)definitely-not-special effects; 5)a supporting cast that either by sheer ineptitude or deliberate malice undermined the leads; 6)a final scene that no one could possibly understand or bear to watch while sober. Michael Anderson should be put against a wall and shot for inflicting this piece of crap on our movie screens."
5515,"If you loved Fassbinder and Herzog....; I was instantly bought back to the early eighties. Sitting in large cold theaters with about 9 other people, watching German films that seemed endless, stupid, amazing and hysterical simultaneously.. And that, is very hard to replicate, but Music From the Second Floor seems to pull it off. Oh, and throw a little Nordic tinged Monty Python in too. This is not an easy movie to watch it takes some effort and perseverance. Yet that has been what is lacking, and is one of the problems with most popular film over the last twenty years . Music from the Second Floor is gritty and gray, and you have to be present while you are watching it. No daydreaming or internal conversations that may distract you from the full on experience. So, if you were one of the other nine watching all of Berlin Alexanderplatz in a two day sitting, this one's for you."
8376,"For the real indie-film lover; Quirky, imaginative, subtle and colourful. Napoleon Dynamite is original and comical to the audience who appreciates the uniqueness mingled throughout the film. How many other movies have a guy throwing a little plastic action figure tied to a string out a school bus window? How many people can say they've seen a llama named Tina eating a casserole? The slow but meaningful plot tugs at your interest in a similar way to Napoleon dragging his brother Kip into town with is bicycle. This film has indie written all over it and with it's quirky characters and down-to-earth, yet strange, reality, this film has all the elements necessary to impress the eccentric movie goer."
7320,"Major Disappointment.; I, unfortunately, purchased this movie before watching. As I am an avid collector, and usually don't mind having a few lame movies in my collection. Nonetheless, this movie was disappointing on every level and I seriously regret my purchase. The acting was seriously lacking in quality and the characters had no chemistry, the dancing was nothing special, the music was good however very inaccurate for the time setting. I knew that this movie would not compare to the first, but I had hopes that it would at least be entertaining. Major disappointment! Had I not had these expectations, I might have possibly found it as about as entertaining as any other cheesy love story, good one time around and that's it!"
168192,"Munster Go Home Retains the Charm; After appearing in 57 of 70 television episodes as Marilyn Munster one would think Pat Priest would have been included in The Munster's FIRST feature length film. There was some lame excuse that she was too old, even though the film was released a year after the series' last episode. Debbie Watson gave a good performance in MGH, but I had a difficult time excepting her as part of the Munster clan. This, however, did not detract from the film that Munster Charm that came to us for two wonderful seasons on The Munsters. I still loved the film in all its brilliant color. I've just purchased the First Season episodes on DVD and am very saddened and surprised to learn Munster Go Home, the DVD version, is currently out out of print. Munster Go Home is as enjoyable as the series and should be offered to all Munster fans of all ages to enjoy."
173125,"Lifeless; Minerologist Paul likes rocks and stones a lot. This explains why he hooks up with Kathy, a stoned looking blond girl with the personality of a boulder. It may also explain why a tiny fragment of moon rock strikes him in the head during a meteor shower. The damage inflicted by the moon rock isn't immediately obvious; it just looks like a minor scratch. But Paul soon becomes terribly ill, plagued by sleeplessness, headaches and dizzy spells. As if that weren't enough, he's also exposed to bad rock bands and Kathy's terribly slutty wardrobe. Soon, people are turning up dead all around town; limbs pulled off, bodies mutilated, claw marks left behind by some huge and hideous beast. As far as the condescending sheriff and smug Professor Johnny Longbow can tell, it's some kind of giant lizard. Native American legend speaks of such a beast, created by a fire which came from the sky. Soon, the obvious becomes quite clear: the monster is Paul, and he must be stopped. This is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. No one in this mess can act, least of all Donna Leigh Drake as Kathy. The scares are silly, the performances stiff, the script awful and Paul is such a dorky, unemotional dweeb that it's almost a relief to see him turn into a giant lizard. Unintentional laughs and cheap special effects make this kind of amusing, but if you're looking for a good scare, look elsewhere. This really is awful."
8984,"Let's not over analyze. Ocean's 12 is what it is.; Despite what its critics ensue, I enjoyed immensely for precisely what it is. Eyecandy for both sides of the gender spectrum. Soderberg has done the artsy hard edge stuff before, won Oscars, is at the top of his game. Ocean's 12 is light, commercial, fluffy, Steve's day at the Midway if you will. I am generally not a fan of Zeta-Jones but even I must admit that Kate is STUNNING in this movie. It's ending screams of an upcoming trequel and I will be one of the millions who flock to see 120 minutes of George and Brad and Matt parlay through Clooney's digs in Lago di Como as they swindle some rich bad guy again and again. If we tolerated 3 installments of the Lord of the Rings, I ask if we can drool over Clooney's salt and pepper lid just one more time?"
3873,"I like Jane Fonda But Totally Hate CAT BALLOU...; I saw CAT BALLOU 40 years ago in the cinema. My parents took me. I found this movie as deeply disturbing then as I do now. I saw the recent broadcast rerun airing of this ""nightmare-ish"" so-called comedy (albeit with no laughs) on Turner Classics Movies. I thought that maybe now that I am 47 -instead of 7 - that I could appreciate the movie better. NO SUCH LUCK. Obviously someone spent a great deal of money producing this movie - that is beyond question. It is an expensive & lavish adaptation of a play which tries its best to spoof the ""WESTERN's-Genre"", but it is a horribly done adaptation that never should have been made at all, or least made as ""true spoof"" maybe starring Imogene Coca & Paul Lynde as co-star... That unbelievably irritating song ""CAT BALLOU"" and with all that ""Wolf's City Wyoming - 1892"" garbage. In my mind I can imagine Jane Fonda hiding under a rock after the premiere in total embarrassment that her name was associated with such trash. No wonder she became a nut case during the Vietnam War, CAT BALLOU haunted her, probably. If I had to sum up how I feel about this God-Awful Movie in one word, it is ""NAUSIATING""...."
32216,"Into The Sun Review; Action: Steven Seagal looks in the best shape he's been in since Exit Wounds. The action fight sequences unfortunately were few and far between. There was a fight at the mall that was superb, in my opinion this was great, but it was over too soon. This was really the only time where he truly showed off his hard to hand combat moves as well as his Aikido throws. The other fights later on were mainly sword based although there were a few punches. No care chases at all. The movie was certainly more plot based than we are used to for a Steven Seagal movie. Characters: Steven Seagal get's a partner in this movie, but he is pretty much under-used. There's a few funny moments between them. The other characters are pretty poor too. William Atherton as the boss doesn't seem to interested in his role and the other Chinese and Japanese stars don't improve the movie much either. I sure miss the days when Steven Seagal made movies with a decent support cast. Soundtrack: The radio stations and restaurants in Tokyo must all be tuned in to Steven Seagal FM, everywhere he went his music was playing - i heard a few of his tunes from 'Songs From The Crystal Cave' playing through the film. Overall i counted at least three of his songs including the credits song. The soundtrack was good though. Direction: The movie begins with an action sequence in the jungle, which is not very well done. The opening credits begin and then some graphic work happens to show the movie is in Tokyo. When i saw this is reminded me other Michael Oblowitz's work in 'Out For A Kill' and i thought the worst, but after that panic it was certainly well directed. Good job mink. Overall: Pretty disappointing, i was expecting much more for a budget of $35 million, i don't know where all this money was used as it seems rather excessive considering not much was blown up. It is certainly a better movie than 'Out For A Kill' and 'The Foreigner', but it is not better than 'Belly Of The Beast' and nowhere near as good as his earlier work. For a direct to video effort it is certainly above average though. I must admit i pretty much agree with the review form 'Ain't It Cool'. Rating: 2 / 5"
126729,"Ahead of its time; Not to be confused with the Mario Bava film ""Blood and Black Lace"", this is a low-budget, all-American horror effort that is mostly forgotten now, but was quite ahead of its time back in 1970. It starts out with a brutal double murder with the nasty end of a claw hammer in a scene which predates ""Halloween"" and ""Black Christmas"" in its use of the killer's POV shot, and it ends with a twisted incestual revelation that predates the infamous ""my sister/my daughter"" scene in ""Chinatown"". Most of the action takes place in a brutally run orphanage where anyone who tries to escape meets a very ugly end. The movie has the flavor of a WIP film minus the lesbian sex and shower scenes (although this is one of those strange orphanages that seems to cater almost exclusively to sexy and very mature-looking teenage girls). Gloria Grahame, most famous for playing a prostitute who gets her face scalded by coffee in the 1950's noir ""The Big Heat"", is the cruel head of the orphanage. Melody Patterson is the lead and probably the world's oldest-looking orphan. ""Mel"" from ""Alice"" and ""Uncle Leo""from ""Seinfeld"" also both appear--proving once and for all that they are NOT the same person. Not a very good movie perhaps, but worth watching for curiosity value"
180357,"a beautifully crafted film; Anita and me is one of the most beautifully crafted, hilarious, moving and compelling stories i have ever seen on the big screen. it is a beautiful tale of two young girls who struggle to grow up in a mining village in the 70s. it is without a doubt the greatest movie to come from Britain in a very long time. unlike its counterparts bend it like beckham and east is east. it remains hilarious yet looks head on at some of the grim issues going on in the 70's such as racial abuse and family conflict. often avoided by many movie makers. it is also unlike many of the other bad 70s flashback films. there is a wide variety of elements where you can look and say to yourself... i remember when that record came out! or i remember when my parents used to make me change into play clothes after school! or that time when me and my friend stole a load of sweets from the village shop and blamed it on my niece! not only do i recommend it for people who remember the golden age that was the 70s, but i recommend it for a lot of young women who struggle with the day to day struggles of being a teenager, falling out with friends, wondering why you cant get a boyfriend etc. strongly recommend this film for when you are feeling down or sad. i guarantee it will make you smile!"
5219,"Good survival horror; I had to sift long and deep for a good comment on this. Why all the hostility? I think there was great chemistry on this production and it shows; the actors and crew involved loved the game and had a good time making this. This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline. Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain. With this film you have a good, watchable story that can partake of the Resident Evil cosmology, showing it due respect. It did an excellent job establishing characters without too much unnecessary background, developing them just enough to make you want to know what they'll do next, to make you care before the sudden and gruesome happens to them. The acting was above par for a Resident Evil, certainly much better than the first game. The plot was no more comic bookish than any of the games. My one complaint was that the characters were too battle-trained, too slick, too good at fighting for them to be sympathetic horror subjects. This could've been balanced out with more reaction shots showing the soldiers wetting themselves. But Alice's over-the-top commando-style action made her too much of a super heroine to really make anyone concerned about her survival; characters made of Teflon make good action but apathetic horror subjects."
3754,"Liked it, very funny; I watched the Bullwinkle cartoons as a child but I probably didn't get a lot of the humor back then. Several years ago the cartoons aired on my local UPN station and I was able to appreciate the intelligence of the humor better. In this movie, a lot of the silliness was really over the top and off the wall, but it was the way I like it. I thought the voices of Rocky and Bullwinkle were done perfectly, and Bullwinkle is really funny when he's dumb. While no one really gave Oscar-worthy performances, for what this was, many of the live-action actors did a good job. I wasn't that happy with Piper Perabo as Karen Sympathy except in one scene which I won't mention where she was upset with Bullwinkle's innocence and stupidity). Jason Alexander and Rene Russo made a good team as Boris and Natasha. I enjoyed Robert De Niro as Fearless Leader but this was just a fun role for him, not proof he can really act. I did like John Goodman in his brief appearance as a cop, Whoopi Goldberg as a judge, and Kenan and Kel as students at Bullwinkle's alma mater. Of course this movie made plenty of use of 'breaking the fourth wall'--admitting to being only a movie. Many of the jokes using this technique were hilarious. And even though it wasn't a cartoon, such gimmicks as having characters suspended in the air just before falling--these were great simply because it's not supposed to happen in the 'real' world. This was great, even if some might say it's not in the same league with the animated TV version."
8870,"Outstanding movie!!!; Some comments made said they didn't care for the movie, but as a person who views several movies a day, I was not the least bit disappointed. I didn't have a clue for a good bit of the movie that it involved alien abduction. That alone was a good sign for me. Once it was apparent that the government was covering up for the aliens it really got even more interesting. The manner in which they would snatch the characters from earth was very original. I truly liked that. No feeling, no remorse, and without warning.....just poof and you are whisked away. This movie is great because of an original story, outstanding acting and the effects weren't overdone and it did leave a lot still to the imagination. Very AH. A lot of questions were left unanswered and that was good.....maybe room for part II...Fogotten Again...or something..or maybe just leave them guessing....A part II would have to have more in your face interaction with the beings and tie up loose ends..but it would be worth the effort I think. Definitely a movie worth seeing."
159079,"Wish I Knew What the Writer Intended; A fine ""B"" movie cast is wasted by using awful production values in a project that likely ran out of money before it was finished. The tacked-on ending without a doubt uses different actors than the on-screen talent (Grant Williams, Mala Powers, Denny Miller, Bobby Van). Probably the WORST special effect is the destruction of the earth. ""The Doomsday Machine"" gets a ""3"" from me because it was at least always coherent. It's sad whatever happened during production prevented the movie from being filmed as intended. I feel especially bad for Grant Williams, a fine actor, who was likely blacklisted because of his sexual preferences, not to mention a well publicized feud with Jack Webb, then director of production for Universal. Better William be remembered for ""The Shrinking Man"" and ""Hawaiian Eye"" than this crap. Ditto, Mala Powers for ""The Time Travelers""."
8587,"a stranger-than-fiction true life story; If ""Mayor of the Sunset Strip"" were not a documentary, no one would ever believe the story it tells. The film chronicles the life of Rodney Bingenheimer, the L.A. DJ who helped to launch the careers of many of the most influential bands in rock music history. However, if you're expecting Rodney to be a dashing, high-powered music exec with loads of cash and garages full of fancy sport cars, think again. He is, in fact, a painfully shy and unassuming man who seems totally out of place in the celebrity swirl of which he became so integral a part beginning in the 1960's. This is what makes his story and the film so fascinating, for who could have imagined that this gnomish young lad from Mountain View, California - essentially abandoned by both his mother and father and rejected by his peers - would somehow manage to make himself the center of attention for some of the greatest rock celebrities of the 1960's and '70's. Everybody who was anybody knew and adored Rodney, and, after he landed a gig as DJ at L.A.'s KROQ in the 1970's, he gave many struggling alternative artists their first real toehold on the radio, playing their records at a time when no other disc jockeys would touch them. The bands who practically owe their careers to Rodney Bingenheimer include Blondie, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, the Runaways, the Go-Go's, No Doubt, Coldplay, and many many others. As a documentary, the film, written and directed by George Hickenlooper, takes a fairly conventional approach, combining images from Rodney's life with interviews by celebrities, relatives and friends commenting on him both as a person and as a phenomenon. The film provides a virtual who's who of some of the biggest names in the music business stepping up to the camera to have their say, most of it highly complimentary to the subject. Indeed, almost to a person, the interviewees talk about what a sweet, lovable guy Rodney is and how hobnobbing with so many celebrities has not diminished his innate humility and decency as a person. There is one moment in the film when Rodney allows his anger to get the better of him, but, most of the time, he comes across as a goodhearted, almost passive person who is surprisingly inarticulate and - one senses - not all that comfortable being the subject of a documentary. The film achieves a poignancy and sadness in its latter scenes when we discover that, despite all this notoriety among the glitterati in Hollywood, Rodney lives a rather isolated existence, never having found that one true love with whom he could settle down and make a life. In fact, the movie makes us question whether fame - or even proximity to the famous - can ever really lead to a happy, successful life. It's a lament we've heard many times before and will hear many times again. ""Mayor of the Sunset Strip"" provides us with a kaleidoscopic view of the L.A. music scene from the mid 1960's to the present. Rodney's life becomes the forum for reliving all those exciting moments in which this parade of beautiful and talented people came to define the culture and eras of which they were a part. The film has an almost ""Zelig"" quality to it, as Rodney is photographed standing next to virtually every important rock artist to come down the pike in the last four decades. I must admit that, even after watching ""Mayor of the Sunset Strip,"" I still don't claim to understand how Rodney achieved everything that he did, and maybe no film could ever really capture that magic alignment of elements that made it possible for a shy, insecure young boy from a broken family - yet a boy with dreams and an abiding love of rock 'n roll - to play such a crucial part in music history. I guess you had to actually be there to really understand it. My own experience with Rodney Bingenheimer is an extremely modest one. I once stood behind him while waiting to board a flight from San Jose to Burbank. Few people in the crowd seemed to know who he was, but an attractive young girl, obviously interested in pursuing a career in music, approached him and politely engaged him in conversation. Rodney, despite the fact that he could have simply ignored her advances and begged for privacy, instead turned his full attention to what it was she was saying, smiled demurely at her compliments, and offered her an opportunity to perform for him when they got back to L.A. It's that Rodney Bingenheimer who comes through in the film."
30816,"A work of Art; What a masterpiece!!!! Personally, i don't like musicals, they tend to be ridiculous (people dance all the time and we forget about the storyline, and the soundtrack usually isn't good) but as i saw it was made by Joel Schumacher i gave a try. Well, all i can say is that is one of the bests (if not the best) movies i've ever seen. Firstly the story is spectacular and, in addition all the songs helps to the development of the plot. Secondly, the soundtrack is awesome!!!! The voices are very well chosen. I call this movie a piece of real art: every song is well adapted to the situations and are contextual to the whole plot."
3739,"The Summit Of PreCode Cinema; ...and Ernst Lubitsch at his zenith. First things first: thank you to TCM for showing this recently. Of course I taped it, and of course I've practically worn the tape out by now, a month later. Point #2: something is terribly wrong in Paradise if the peak era of his work, 29-33, remains in shadow today. Where are the VHS/DVD releases of these wonderful films? Nowhere that I can find them; hopefully the good folks at Turner will continue reviving the early sound Lubitsches. I waited 25 years to see this one again, and the wait was not in vain. Those 25 years put a bit of snow on my roof, but they also allowed me to drink in the ambrosia that is this film with a bit more appreciation than I had at 16. And what intoxicating ambrosia it is! Script, performances, directorial vision are all exquisite. The leads are inspired (oh, for a night with Kay Francis!); the supporting players, expertly calibrated farceurs. The utilization of music as ironic counterpoint to the visuals rivals Clair; the title song, sung over the opening credits, will make your heart race, and break, at the same time. And the look of the film (Art Deco, lovingly handrubbed to a burnished glow) will linger with you forever. Again and again, Lubitsch pulls rabbits out of hats: scenes like the deepening of Herbert Marshall and Kay Francis' relationship from business to pleasure 'seen' in a clock face are emblematic of what makes this such a special film. Its story is slight, frothy, very nearly silly; yet Lubitsch's knowing observation of small, telling details makes it magical. TROUBLE is not a timeless film, anchored as it is to a very specific time (Long Ago) and place (Far Away), which only deepens its charm and its seductive tugging on the audience's sleeve. I've watched it three times in a night, and three times more the following night - not behavior I usually exhibit. But the siren call of its lively, civilized wit is such that I'm hitting 'rewind' the moment it ends - I don't want to break the spell and return to reality just yet. As fertile as the preCode era is, as many classics as that golden period continues to yield up to those willing to discover them...TROUBLE IN PARADISE is the most glorious of them all."
27830,"Superb movie, especially for golf fans.; Bobby Jones stands out in golf history as a singular event. He was an amateur, and remained an amateur, even while he was generally considered the best golfer in the world during the 1920s. He gave up his competitive golf career before he was 30, after he won what was the 'grand slam' of his day, the Open, the US Open, the US Amateur, and the Bristish Amateur titles all in the same year. His outlook was simple, once you began playing the game for money, you no longer played for the love of the game. Even though Jones retired very young, he went on in the 1930s to make a series of landmark golf instructional films, many with a cast and a story, instead of simply dry instruction. And perhaps his most lasting legacy is his creating the Augusta National golf course and the Masters tournament played there every year. Jim Caviezel creates Bobby Jones. We see him as an overly competitive young man with a hot temper. He regularly pounded the ground or threw clubs after a particularly bad shot. One time, his club bounced into a woman spectator and injured her slightly, and this event was to change Bobby. He remained competitive, but learned to control his temper, and how to win tournaments instead. Claire Forlani is a very good Mary Malone Jones, Bobby's young devoted wife who saw how competition tore him up inside. It was she who got Bobby to think seriously of retiring from competition when he did. Jeremy Northam was good as Walter Hagen, the boozing carefree professional who eventually became an admirer of Jones'. Malcolm McDowell, the Brit, was good as O.B. Keeler, the reporter who became a friend as well as a fan of Jones'. Aidan Quinn does a good turn as Harry Vardon who was one of the best when Jones came on the scene. I am a golfer, I admire the career of Bobby Jones, and the person that he was. I give this movie my highest rating."
7294,"Ray Romano is the wimpiest character ever seen on celluloid 1/10; Ray Romano's character is the wimpiest character ever seen on celluloid. This guy is so wimpy. He is bossed by women for the entire film. He is even beat by his girlfriend many times. I bet this is supposed to be ""funny"". This film is not funny at all. Both Romano and Hackman characters are wimps. A bunch of annoying people constantly tell them what to do throughout the entire film. For example, the former president has to listen to a dumb boy (Fred Savage) and a dumb woman who constantly run his life. Also in the french version they gave Romano's Owen Wilson's voice. I don't know who does this voice, but this voice must be the more annoying and unfunny voice ever seen in the history of french translation. Anyway this movie was really bad. I give 1/10 to it."
5136,"Creepy Trip to Nowhere; While visually and audibly atmospheric,as well as some powerful opening scenes, ""Wendigo"" remains too ambiguous to be satisfying. The biggest failures come in the unexplained history of the menacing Otis as well as a poorly render ""Wendigo."" ""Curse of the Demon"" did a similar monster nearly 50 years ago and it is MUCH better than the ""Wendigo."" I give ""Wendigo"" a ""4"". It's too bad, because the performances are uniformly good. Jake Weber and the actor playing Otis come across best. If you ever saw an episode of ""Touching Evil,"" you can appreciate how much better the photographic and audio effects are used here. Pity, the movie comes across as unfinished."
924,"Best Movie Ever; Well, all i can say is that 2001 space odyssey is and will be the best movie of ever. Thanks Kubrick's vision, the story of the movies changed forever. It began, for good, the so called ""science-fiction"" movies. Better than that, it gave birth to the ""meditation"" movies, meaning this movie is not only a movie about the man on space, but also a movie about the human condition. Really a cult movie. Another thing that kubrick got it right was the fact that in space there's no sound, so instead of the noise of the spaceships, we have classical music (which i personally love). Even the scenarios, the furniture, everything, and of course...the ending scene...really transcendental. Like i said....best movie ever was, and ever will be"
8874,"You've Got Red on You; ""You've got red on you"" is a clever bit of repeated dialog, and harbinger of things to come. 'The living dead': look closer for an analogy. Protagonist Shaun seems to exist in a dead world. As he rides the bus to work, we become aware of the masses of soul-dead people slogging to work. If Shaun's a loser, he's about to become a hero. Will he get the girl? Again? Brilliant dialog, slapstick, and satire stylize this quirky comedy/horror flick. The editing is brilliant: flowing yet abrupt scene changes keep us on edge  along with the somewhat startling soundtrack. In the beginning of the film look for background scenes as characters manifest the onset of zombie metamorphoses. Note: film has shown us that zombies move extremely slowly, that they're not very bright and seem to be food-centric. Therein lie methods for coping with them. I admit it: the so-called comedy/horror genre has long been a guilty pleasure of mine: An American Werewolf in London . . . Cast A Deadly Spell . . . Cemetery Man. Kudos to the excellent writers, director and cast! Brits Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg are now on my radar. Also recommended: Frankenweenie http://imdb.com/title/tt0087291/ Cast a Deadly Spell http://imdb.com/title/tt0101550/ Popcorn http://imdb.com/title/tt0102690/"
27840,"awful; I have to say this movie did not make me appreciate the Lationo population in the United States anymore than before. I was already aware that Latinos really help out in our nation like everyone else does. This movie was so satirical and exaggerated so much that it took away from its purpose to show that Lations are taken for granted in states like California. The acting was also pretty poor in some cases and the purple fog was never explained nor was where the Latinos went in the first place. I know I'm not supposed to know where they went but I like resolution. I'll admit, there were some clever parts in the movie but it didn't flow well enough to make it memorable."
174563,"Must Watch !; Shwaas is awesome ! considering that the producers had a meagre budget, they have done an excellent job. It is a must watch. The small kid has done an excellent job with a lot of emotions flowing through his eyes. Grandfather is at his best. The photography is superb. Technically correct and very creative. It helps in adding a lot of emotions to the mainstream content. The movie will keep u engrossed and don't be surprised if you are shaken after the movie and the story lingers in your mind for a few days.I sincerely hope that they make it to the final Oscar nomination Enjoy and again don't miss it"
8830,Cheesily good; I must admit i am a HUGE fan of movies that are entertaininly cheesy. THey never take themselves too seriously and they are a good way to relax for an hour or two and be entertained. And with only a few exceptions this movie did that. The cast of incredibly good looking people for the most part did a good job with what they were given. I especially liked Sam (Kadee Strickland)who could have easily become annoying. The character of Cole is a black mark on this movie though. He Was annoying to the point you were praying for the snakes to eat him. And i kinda wished the snakes would have been done better and that they're would have been more of them. but overall it was a good cheesy movie 3/5
293,"My Favorite; I've seen it 15 times and i'm willing to see it again and again and again. First of all, I didn't expect such a common story to be cinematographed in such an extraordinary way...The whole idea of a professional assassin who like another caged lion tries to get away is old in cinematography. However, it is composed with passion for freedom.I give credits for that to Luc Besson(writer and director) and Thierry Arbogast (director of photography).Every scene could be a short movie by itself and that is another characteristic of the movie's power. Acting is exceptional: Gary Oldman of course steals the show from everyone(as he does in every movie he has played). Natalie Portman is the definition of the term actress. As for Jean Reno I believe that no other actor could give better the picture of an ""assassin under obligation"". The movie is dressed with the most emotional and breathtaking music i've ever heard for an action film. Probably this is why ""Leon"" is a movie that cannot be categorized in only one film category...It's like a Love Story wrapped in Action inside a Drama. I cannot put it next to any other movie because it combines various ways of film-making. Luc Besson used close portraits for intriguing, took advantage of the light in such a degree that in the end it became one more excellent actor of the film and kept the colors restrained in order for the atmosphere to be ""killing""."
4228,"Female version of ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels""; This female version of ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" is extremely funny. Excellent, tight, laugh-out-loud script, with acting, direction, and editing to match. Zips along, every line and every scene a winner. In their zeal/greed to con men, mother-daughter team Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt keep getting themselves into impossible situations and then getting themselves out in witty, ingenious ways. Even the usual mother-daughter tension gets elevated to new heights. Everything in this movie is hilarious, including the small scenes and things that go on in the background, like Gene Hackman's parrot; Ray Liotta goes fishing; and anything Anne Bancroft does. Locations are as gorgeous as the cast."
26249,"Highly Entertaining Spaghetti Western; (one *slight* spoiler in the last line) What a great movie, one of the best spag westerns I've seen so far. I didn't find this movie to be as funny as I thought it was going to be based on the other reviews I've read, but I did find it to be a thoroughly entertaining gem with a slightly twisted world-view. For me the strong appeal of this film was a result of the many strong characters and just as importantly, a tight, well written script which gets more and more compelling with each passing scene. By the time the film reached its conclusion I was totally drawn in. I'm not surprised that there were so many sequels to this ... at the end, when Trinity and Bambino (Terrence Hill and Bud Spencer) inevitably ride off into the sunset their characters are so interesting you really want to follow them and find out what's going to happen to them next. Not to mention the other characters like the Major and the drunk Mexican (I heard this was really Sonny Bono in one of his early roles? Just kidding.) I liked the ending of this film. Although there's never any doubt that Trinity and Bambino will prevail, the way they win the day was unexpected, and, in keeping with the traditional western archetype, the violent men who win with their fists and revolvers suddenly find themselves out of place in the stable society they help to build. I would not say this is the greatest western of all of all time, but definitely an entertaining way to spend a Saturday afternoon and the type of characters and plot I wish we would see more of from today's filmmakers. Plus ... how often do you get to see a bunch of Mormons kicking holy ass? Bart Blackstone * Film Club Hollywood CA"
1101,Good Action; This movie was a great action flick. It had all you ever for an action film between the actors and the action - but that's all it was - action. Perhaps I have read too many Drama comments but there are many more action movies out there that are better than Topgun but it will always have its cult following. Including me sad to say. I do not agree that this is a 'chick flick' I think it is for us all. Looking back now it is interesting to see Val Kilmer and Tom Cruise when they were much younger. All in all a good film but there is better action out there.
27706,"The Moose Hole - A Truly Fortunate Experience; The story for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a practically flawless presentation of some of the most cultivated content, though still stylized enough to be categorized as a family-oriented feature, aimed for the pre-teenage set this side of the Harry Potter fantasy universe. Even with that in mind, that material is still enriching enough to spark a certain amount of constructive debate among its desired audience base. All of this is assured of course given that you are not one of the crazed novel enthusiasts who howl and moan every time a mere sentence is altered from the text. It is always more appropriate that you go into these sorts of films without any prior knowledge of the previously released texts as this sort of thing can only lead to nick-picking, a terrible and annoying habit which ruins the viewing experience for everyone involved  those members of the Harry Potter, and to a lesser extent The Lord of the Rings, sects know exactly what this means. As was the case with Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas, there will undoubtedly be critics of Jim Carrey's amplified antics in the role of the villainous Count Olaf, no more so then from the fanatic fan-base of the literary series, clamoring that his interpretation of the character offset his truly monstrous nature and intentions as the novels indicate. Yes, Carrey does give about an amusing quality to Count Olaf, or maybe that is only do to the workings of the young orphans against him that we find so entertaining. In either case, crucial scenes such as the one where he is show slapping Klaus for speaking up against him in front of his acting troupe demonstrates the character's truly malevolent nature which must be despised and scorned rather then mock. This becomes even more evident when children take into account the idea that Count Olaf is attempting to kill his own relatives  no matter how distant  for his own profitable gain. Meryl Streep, an Academy-Award wining performer entirely unfamiliar with the realm of family-oriented productions such as this, takes to the role like a total natural with no question to her magic implored in the role of Aunt Josephine. And what is more is that she does this without having to be as drunk as a skunk as she was at the recent Golden Globes ceremony  Alright, that was not exactly an evaluation of her performance but rather a well deserved jab that has been in quite seclusion for quite some time waiting for the appropriate moment to be let loose. Jude Law, who without question has become the Colin Farrell of 2004 after appearing in what would seem like twenty films this year alone, gives to the narrator of Lemony Snicket a composed, mystifying, and regularly witty voice that could not have been delivered as respectively as he does here. Overall, though literary zealots may whimper and wail over the very thought of even the tiniest aspect of the franchise changing in this feature film adaptation, what to them may seem like a series of unfortunate events might, in fact, be the first steps of an even greater and more whimsical franchise ahead. One of the most marvelous aspects this film manages to present successfully to its audience is its ability to not only entertain but inform as well, not merely through a monotonous series of long-winded speeches but a variety of operations that, no matter how exaggerated they may be, reflect upon experiences in our own lives. The young children who are anticipated to be A Series of Unfortunate Events' core audience this holiday season are at quite a vulnerable age, standing at what some would consider ""the water's edge"". Slowly but surely they are beginning to mature into free-thinking and conscious adults and admirable members of society, or as close as they can be depending on the behavior of one's own family. Though it is suppose to be the direct responsibility of the parents to instill in their children lessons to assimilate throughout life, it certainly does not hurt to have popular culture such as films like this expand on their teachings. The most sensational thing pertaining to the characters of this film is that they teach us that even the best of individuals have their own little quirks about them but, despite these seeming strange to us, they do not change the natural good inside them that they have already demonstrated. In fact, they may even make them better individuals. Another lesson too many children in this world learn all too late in this life is that the world is not always a happy and fair place and events do not always work out in the way we would want them to. Those that raise their children with the hippie-dippy view of society, that being that all men and women no matter how evil they may seem have a source of good in them, should be jailed for child neglect. What a horrible and ignorant way to propagate their minds like that! But Lemony Snicket's most decisive lesson taught within the course of this film is that no matter where you are or how dire the situation may be, as long as you are surrounded by friends and family, you are never truly far from your home. Quite simply, this is the best family film this holiday season and will sure to go down as one of top ten family features of the year."
30818,"Loved this Movie; Saw it last night with my wife at a local theatre, theatre was crowded, being Saturday night. Thoroughly enjoyed movie, loved surrealistic theme and interaction with young BD. Music was excellent, Spacey sounds so very much like BD, maybe better in some cases. Only wish that more of movie had had to do with his other talents, piano (he had a top- 10 solo piano hit in 1960, forget the song's name), guitar (saw him at Lake Tahoe in 1973, phenomenal guitar player), Cornet (used to include solos in all his shows), drums (would also do solos, said to be better than his own drummer by a long shot). The surrealistic theme of the movie did tend to ignore the somewhat darker side of his character that could be pretty nasty indeed... glad they included his family makeup/mixup as an element, explains a lot about his drive, etc. I had heard that he had known about his sister being his mother from a very young age but had put it out of his memory. This subplot worked itself into the story pretty well. I'm not sure that Dick Clark had that much to do with his initial success at all, the men never really knew each other all that well. The big thing about the movie last night was the applause by the full house audience as the credits were running, quite loud and sustained. Looking around, most if not all of the people in there were our age (60 to 70) and all were very much shaken by the movie. How did he say it? "" Our memories will be whatever we want them to be"" or something like that. That is just about what I felt. The things that happened and were happening to me while I was listening to his records fill an enormous part of my memory bank. I'm sure that held true from everyone I saw leaving the theatre. He had such an impact on so many lives"
1069,"Classic Film Noire!; Raymond Chandler's ""Murder My Sweet"" is a classic example of 1940s film noire. It has all of the elements of the genre; dark shadows, night scenes, plenty of cigarette smoke, mist, crisp black and white photography together with murder and mystery. Private eye Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell) is approached one night by the aptly named Moose Malloy (Mike Mazurki) who has just been released from prison and wants Marlowe to find his former girlfriend Velma. Along the way, Marlowe is framed for the murder of a foppish man named Marriott (Douglas Watson). Marriott's murder leads Marlowe into a web of intrigue involving a valuable jade necklace. Villain Jules Amithor (Otto Kruger) thinks Marlowe has the necklace and pressures him to surrender the jewels. Amithor drugs Marlowe in an effort to make him talk. Marlowe also meets the Grayle family, father (Miles Mander) his daughter Ann (Anne Shirley) and voluptuous young wife Helen (Claire Trevor). Some how the two plots become intertwined with Malloy throwing in with Amithor in order to find his Velma. Ann and Helen alternately make moves on Marlowe for various reasons. Finally Marlowe figures out the whole mystery and........ Dick Powell had been a successful musical song and dance man in the 1930s but his career had slowed. He re-invented himself with this picture and would play many similar tough guy roles for the rest of his career. Claire Trevor too was re-inventing herself as a ""femme fatale"". Anne Shirley had been a child actress and adopted the name of her character in the movie ""Anne of Green Gables"" (1934). Also in the cast are Donald Douglas as the police lieutenant, Esther Howard (in a delightful bit) as Jessie Florian and veterans Dewey Robinson and Ernie Adams as the owner and bartender of a bar. This movie was remade in 1975 under its original title ""Farewell My Lovely"" with Robert Mitchum as Marlowe."
30825,"The Moose Hole - 'Focker'ed Up!; The story for Meet the Fockers no where near meets the magnificence or the brilliant humor of the original. Unlike Meet the Parents, in which the filmmakers simply ran with newfound ideas and allowed the storyline to flow consistently with little interruption, the sequel forces too much down the throats of its audience. It acts in the same way as the finale to The Matrix trilogy did in that the fanfare had built up so many ideas and theories as how it should be done that by the time it was released, no matter what would have been done or not, it was bound to disappoint someone. Sadly enough, this is the card Meet the Fockers is dealt having been released so long, nearly four years, after the original surprise hit. Both Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller return to the roles they made famous four years ago, Jack Byrnes, the ultra-conservative recently retired CIA agent, and Greg ""Gaylord"" Focker, the male nurse vying for Jack's daughter's hand in marriage. They work well together once again but not quite at the level they did in the original film. Perhaps since the audience knows how they act against each other already, there are not that many surprises left and therefore less tension and humor to present to the audience. Seeing the Focker family in all their humiliating glory is the most prominent reason why this film should never have made it off the drawing board. Sure, it is quite humorous to simply imagine all the possibilities that could have been developed from this group, but when actually taking the initiative and presenting them in fresh and blood forms in front of our faces, it turns out not to be quite as pleasing as we would have thought. Choosing Dustin Hoffman for the role of Greg's father, Bernie Focker, a former lawyer and stay-at-home father, may have seemed like quite an odd choice at first, especially considering he has not had much experience in the way of flat-out comedies such as this, but now we can see why the decision was made  the man is absolutely hilarious. Who knew a talented actor such as Hoffman had this sort of comedic talent inside of him? After witnessing his performance in this film, he should seriously consider doing more of these types of films as he works quite well at least in this character. Bernie acts as a direct representation of some of the best, if not the most blundering, aspects Greg possesses. He always seems to be doing his best to please everyone but no matter what he does or how hard he tries, it perpetually ends up going badly or embarrassing for someone. The exception here is that Bernie is more cool, collected, and sound about these types of situations then Greg is. For some reason or another, everyone on the planet, Ben Stiller above everyone else, thought Barbra Streisand should play the role of Greg's mother, Roz Focker, the sexual therapist for the elderly, in the highly anticipated sequel. Whether they truly desired to see her perform once again on screen for the first time in nearly nine years or if they had to seriously consider the most annoying and embarrassing liberal hippie and her name just kept automatically coming up, the point remains the same the she works only in limited capacities. Barbra, in a way representing the film as a whole, is laughable, but not so funny as to make her performance all that memorable or worth the price of repeated admission. Most of her jokes are sexual in nature and though some of them are decent gut-busters to begin with, they grow quite old as the film drags on until a certain point where they are no longer funny and are just disgusting. Overall, the sequel to the 2000 comedy smash-hit is not quite as horrific as the filmmakers certainly could have made it, but neither is it as exhilarating and original as the first film was either. Here is yet another prime example as to why Hollywood should be prevented from being so God damn greedy as to ruin a practically pristine and memorable stand-alone film as Meet the Parents with an unnecessary and vapid sequel. After such dismaying disasters as The Whole Ten Yards and Analysis That  another film starring Robert De Niro  you would think that studio executives would have gotten that message not to bite off more then they can chew. Meet the Fockers is so testable that it should be placed on a pike in front of the entrance of every movie studio in the state of California as a constant terrifying reminder that there are some things in this world that should never be tempered with  tangible stand-alone films most of all. Honestly, the only audience members that may ever receive personal satisfaction from this lack-luster sequel in any way whatsoever will be hardcore conservatives knowing that from now on they can refer to Barbra Streisand, the queen of the banshees in Hollywood, as Mother Focker, which is worth more then anyone will know. But considering they would have to endure seeing at least twenty minutes worth of footage with her cleavage blazoned on the screen, not to mention paying money to gouge out their own eyes, they do themselves a favor and not waste their money, or their eyes, on this. True, not all of Meet the Fockers is a complete disaster. In fact it does offer quite a few laughable moments but unfortunately most audience members will find themselves forcing a laugh rather then just letting loose as real comedies should have you do."
30810,"The Moose Hole - Anderson's Most Ambitious Adventure To Date; Internationally renowned oceanographer Steve Zissou is about to embark on his most ambitious adventure to date. He is vividly determined to avenge his partner's death by tracking down the elusive and mysterious Jaguar Shark, should it even exist at all, that ate his best friend during the filming of their last documentary together and destroy it. Joining the rest of Team Zissou for the voyage are a young co-pilot from Kentucky named Ned Plimpton, who may or may not be Steve Zissou's son, and a magazine journalist sent to interview the documentarian for a cover profile. Unfortunately, the expedition does not go as smoothly as might have been planned. Steve not only has to deal with his co-producer and estranged wife, the brains behind the operation, but also a severe lack of funding, pirates, a kidnapping, and a near mutiny. The story for The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou may appear to an unfortunately substantial majority of the viewing audience as an ambitious retelling of the classic sea-legend of Moby Dick but thankfully Anderson's noble storyline effort has far more heart then that. Simply put, this is about a man who comes to the realization that he is a failure in life, both as a scientist and as a family man. Zissou's redemption near the end of the film is that he never was what the commercialization or even his own personality on screen built him up be beyond that of a vivid storyteller. That is who Steve Zissou is to Steve Zissou. And, though it may not seem like much to some people, it is a decent enough existence for him and he comes to accept it, be it requiring the loss of a close friend to fully comprehend this revelation. True, his name included within the title of the film automatically deems him the focus of the feature in the eyes of an awaiting audience, but beyond the simplistic, Bill Murray's sarcastic nature and suppressed appearance defines the character of Steve Zissou and gathers the full attention of those who come to the understanding of Wes Anderson's brilliant screenplay. After losing his best friend to the mysterious Jaguar shark, Zissou's world comes crashing down around him and failure confronts him in almost every aspect of his life. His explanation to Ned as to why he did not want to become a father to him, or to anyone else for that matter, may strike some people as overtly harsh at first but as one digs deeper into the failure of Steve's life that he is just coming to realization of, it eventually becomes quite reasonable and even acceptable. Owen Wilson, who has become yet another staple of a Wes Anderson film, works well opposite Murray in the role of Ned Plimpton, or as he is later called Kingsley Zissou, a man who may or may not be Steve's only son. The conversations the two of them have throughout the film, the most notable being the scene where Ned tries to come up with a nickname to call Steve, opens the audience up to the difficulty they have establishing a relationship together as family. Cate Blanchett, who by sheer luck for the role became pregnant right before shooting began on the film, radiates on screen, both literally and figuratively, as magazine journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson who comes aboard this voyage to interview Steve Zissou. Several moments of comic relief, possibly the only instances where members of the audience bored with the rest of the film may recall enjoying, come in the form of Willem Dafoe as Klaus Daimler. Despite there being a clear abundance of odd-ball characters aboard Team Zissou, Steve being among them, Klaus stands clearly above the rest of the supporting cast, offsetting the film's more seriously toned atmosphere and message. Overall, and with all joking aside, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is without a doubt writer/director Wes Anderson's most ambitious adventure to date as few beyond his consistently increasing circle of cult followers, and quite possibly even a meager amount within, will judge the face value of the film beyond what is skimmed on the surface. The problem with films such as this one is they tend to perform better, critically and financially, in two key areas  one, as a word of mouth picture (sadly to say, this film failed to receive much of a substantial backing despite sold out shows in New York and LA), or secondly, strictly as a DVD or VHS rental. The Life Aquatic, and, to be honest, most Wes Anderson films in general, is one of those rare films that require numerous viewings with careful attention to details and specific lines of dialogue in order to fully obtain the emotional direction and deliberately embedded message the filmmaker is attempting to express. In all likelihood, The Life Aquatic will end up being a financial failure for Touchstone Pictures, given the fifty million dollar production budget and its less then impressive opening weekend numbers in wide release, but in giving them credit there are few studios this year that can stand proud and claim that their film was a noble financial failure if anything else. Yes, the pacing of the film is gradual and not everything that is touched on thematically in the film is laid out on a silver plate for everyone to indulge in but perhaps that is reason enough why this film should be appreciated more then it has been. Those that walk away from this film appreciating it not only for its breathtaking cinematography and creative backgrounds but also for its ingenious style of direction, brilliant use of dialogue, and thematic messages that require actual thought, will give The Life Aquatic more then any money in the world could."
6959,A Great Fantasy; Imagine going back 500 years? Would that not be neat? I think they have done credit to Michael Crichton's novel by making this movie enjoyable to watch. The actors play their roles well and this was not a huge budget movie. The scenery looks real and the costumes are good. The diversity and nationalities between the actors doesn't hinder the movie at all. The concept is good - I especially like how they made the Lady Claire and Marek couple work throughout the movie. They were also able to show the savage times they lived in back then extremely well. So historically I thought it was good too. Not a great film but not bad either. My teenage children liked it - which is tells you something - or nothing.
4888,"Past ignited in motel room....; This film took me two days to decide whether I liked it or not. When the final credits rolled, rather creatively at that, I couldn't figure out if this was pure brilliance on the part of Richard Linklater, or if it was nothing more than a group of friends trying to make an independent film. I could not decide. I even listened to the audio commentary of Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater to see if I could capture their mood of the film to hopefully influence mine. While it was a very interesting audio commentary, it only provided more indecisiveness. After thinking about this for two days, I finally thought about it long enough and realized that if a film makes you think for two days after viewing, there has to be something spectacular about it, and there was. After two days I was able to put my finger on it. You had a very chilling story, a deeply disturbing confession, a powerhouse of acting by Robert Sean Leonard and Uma Thurman, and then there was Ethan Hawke. I put him aside because it was his acting, his portrayal of Vince that took away the inches of film that nearly made it into perfection. Let me explain. This is a story, that on the surface seems small, is very large in structure. While its only setting is inside a motel room, the written word by Stephen Belber transforms this into a thrilling drama about past lives and future consequences. From the opening scene of Hawke throwing his beers into the motel door until the final dramatic conclusion where Vince is caught up in the web of his own lies, we never really know anything about him. Leonard talks briefly about what he is doing and why he is currently single, but we never really get to know Ethan's character. This is what muddled in my mind for those two days, I continually had to ask myself who Vince really was. Was he a friend trying to help Leonard with a guilty conscious, or was he on the side of Amy trying to give her the conclusion that she wanted. Who knows? I think I needed more structure with Ethan's Vince. We needed more from Linklater to help us understand this self-appointed villain, or even more from Ethan to reveal his ultimate purpose. Instead, what occurred was Ethan just jumping around being annoying with no purpose except what you could hear Linklater telling him. Here is what I could hear: ""Ok, Ethan, your purpose in this scene is to ensure that Leonard doesn't leave, do whatever it takes"". Ethan takes this direction and adds a couple of swear words and uses screaming to keep him in the room instead of countering with more plot. Does this make sense? I felt like I knew why Leonard and Thurman were there in that room, but WHY Ethan was bringing them together was never told. I know that perhaps it was left up to the viewer, but this story needed a hint. It needed to provide some reasoning for the situation. I felt Ethan held us back from learning that. Someone else in the role may have done better, but Ethan just felt lost and stagy. As I said before, Leonard and Thurman really carried this film on their shoulders. I was impressed to see Leonard taking such heavy work, but his true acting ability really came forth. The same goes for Uma who successfully took the idea of ""husband and wife"" away while working with Ethan. I was concerned that it would be a factor in Tape, but luckily these two were able to keep their characters separate. The chemistry that Leonard and Thurman had on screen was shattering. I found myself holding my breath during their parts from both emotion and the tension that they created. Outside of Ethan, they did a great job. The story was a very tight story. I loved being brought into the middle of this controversy and seeing that a world can be created and destroyed in a hotel room. I thought that concept was a hard one to tackle, but Stephen Belber (who also wrote the play) did a fantastic job of eliminating the corporate element and giving us the pure human drama that exists between these characters. Linklater likewise really pulls this film together well by keeping the tensions high and elaborate as our characters progress through the phases of this predicament. The only trouble I had with Linklater's direction deals with his swirling camera. Whenever two people were talking to each other we found ourselves swirling between the two instead of using one large shot or quick cuts. I thought this was annoying at times, and quite dizzying. It detracted from the words that the actors were speaking and from the impact of the story. That is my only critique of Linklater's direction, which was nearly flawless. Overall, this was an impressive and very intense drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat due to its strong reality and human element. It took me a while for me to realize this, and will probably take some time for it to sink into your mind, but that is the nature of this film. It is created to leave this lasting impression on your mind and to haunt your mind during your next visit with friends. I think Linklater did an excellent job with the material that he was handed, proving that his work could be compared to early Cameron Crowe material. Leonard and Thurman explode onto the scene, while Hawke leaves a bit more to be desired. I do believe that Linklater should have considered another actor for his role. Either way, this was a great film that took away the classic Hollywood backdrop and gave us nothing but 100% pure acting. Grade: **** out of *****"
30812,"The Moose Hole - 'The Aviator' Soars!; The story for The Aviator resurrects the aberrant life of Howard Hughes and presents it in the grandiose, nostalgic, and mythological style that only Martin Scorsese could have achieved so seamlessly and effectively all at the same time. In spite of its lavish three-hour time length, the film's flow and consistency is never once interrupted by abrupt slow periods, nor does it ever outpace its audience's ability to divulge information at a reasonable pace. Already at this point it is leaps and bounds ahead of the bumbling monstrosity that was Gangs of New York. And although the first few minutes of the picture in which Hughes' mother bathes the young boy in a tub of water in a dimly lit room and speaks to him of avoiding the disease-filled residence of a neighbor may seem a bit awkward when it first starts out, given time it will be made all the more understandable as eloquent symbolism to the sporadic nature of Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes, whether he be the man, the legend, or quite possibly a combination of the two, truly is the focus of this picture and Leonardo DiCaprio, having been snubbed in years past for his roles in both Titanic and Gangs of New York, captures brilliantly the eccentric aviator's maverick personality and from the very first scenes instantly grapples the attention of his audience in much the same way as Hughes would have wanted it done. Whether or not he receives a golden statuette this time around, let alone receives a nomination at the Academy Awards ceremony, DiCaprio, in the short years since his breakout performance in the smash-hit Titanic, has built up quite an impressive resume none-the-less, especially given that he has actually demonstrated true acting potential rather then simply riding the wave of pure publicity and hype. Cate Blanchett, an especially gifted actress who has rounded up in recent years particularly well-deserved acclaim from critics for her roles in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Veronica Guerin, reflects perfectly the extraordinary, if not often curious, nature of the late-Katharine Hepburn. Alan Alda, famous for his portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce in the acclaimed television series M*A*S*H, proves that in all his years in the glitzy Hollywood business he has failed to lose his touch, giving a brilliantly stark performance as the conniving Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. In a particular scene in which the senator invites Howard to a luncheon meeting in a last ditch effort to avoid a public hearing and have him fold on the refutation of his new aviation bill, he appears as though he takes pleasure in tormenting Hughes' now apparent mental condition, going so far as to pick up a glass at the last minute and place a smudge mark on it directly in Hughes' line of sight. Splendidly Hughes, refusing to be baited and racking his bodily functions to fight back the affects of his mental condition, stuns Brewster by drinking straight out of that glass and forces him to be on the defensive, a position no one, let alone a senator of the United States Congress, finds comfortable. Surely not everything that Hughes did, most notably taking money from the government for projects he never completed or delivered and bribing military contractors, can be defined as just but he can not be blamed entirely for that given that those were the sign of the times. If anything, this investigation brought about a change in the way the aviation industry would be dealt with and Hughes' stern rebuttal of Brewster's true intentions single-handedly restored the idea of capitalism in yet another branch of the U.S. industrial system. Overall, The Aviator, in much the same light as its subject of discussion, is larger then life itself and for what seems once in a blue moon on the screen that does not go aggressively against it, ensuring its rightful place as the film to beat this awards season. The film ends rather abruptly with Hughes standing directly in front of a grungy bathroom mirror, repeating the phrase ""wave of the future"", and should the audience feel angered or disappointed by this conclusion then Martin Scorsese will have successfully pulled off his desired effect. True to form, the life of Howard Hughes' was never the same again from that moment on. For the mythic man who had done so much in his lifetime up to that point and at the same time had far more yet to accomplish, Hughes' condition spiraled out of control, reducing him to live in total obscurity in one of his several casinos in Las Vegas, dying of kidney failure. That, ladies and gentlemen, is truly the disheartening conclusion to the eccentric, yet majestic, life of Mr. Howard Hughes. The man who perhaps was greatly overshadowed by the legendary figure he helped create and whose shoes he could not fill. Scorsese, a man always willing to be daring and take a risk when it comes to the exact look and feel of a particular film, brilliantly  how many times can that be said of him  captures in each year that is represented the accurate visual style of the color film of that time period, whether it was the old-fashioned Cinecolor or the two-strip Technicolor film. And as the story progresses, the film's appearance matures and fills out more, giving The Aviator a visual quality all its own, setting its miles apart from the competition. Undoubtedly this film will not be everyone's cup of tea, as disappointing as that may be to hear given as how apparently masterful it is, but rest assured that given the proper number of viewings and a through understanding of the life and time of the man who was Howard Hughes, it will be easy for anyone to see as to why this will be the film that gives Scorsese his absurdly overdue Academy Award this year."
30816,"Mind Boggling; I, as a musician am an avid music fan. I consider myself an ""eclectic listener,"" if you will. So, naturally musicals are a second nature to me. I've sat through the classics such as Sound of Music, Fiddler on the Roof, just inspired from start to finish. Phantom has definitely topped them all- From the moment the reel began, this movie almost stopped me from breathing, I was that caught up in it. The power and magnitude of the sound behind it blew me away. It makes you feel as if you're a part of the action, being the one swooned by Gerard Butler. In my opinion, this is by far one of the best movies I've seen, atop the list with the Titanic smash and Pearl Harbor. I saw this movie 3 times, and though movie prices are skyrocketing, I plan to experience the chills at least once more."

6250,"This is the WORST film I've ever seen in my life.; I can not believe Morgan Freeman of all people took a role in a train wreck of a film like Dreamcatcher. He must of been hard up for cash. What was this film even about? A bunch of aliens come all the way to American just to drive across country? I've seen some bad films in my day but this takes the cake. Amazing that it even got made to begin with. It's hard to even come up with 10 lines to write about this movie. Who were we at war with, the aliens or the military? Movies like this make me never want to spend 10 bucks on a film again. The producers and writes of this disaster of a film should quit their day jobs."
1198,"The genre defining adventure film; There have been movies in the past that have defined their own genre. Such as The Godfather defined the new style mob movies, Star Wars defined the new style of Sci-Fi movies, and then Raiders Of The Lost Ark defined a new type of action adventure. In Raiders Of The Lost Ark, we see a daring adventurer named Indiana Jones(Harrison Ford) seek to find the ark of the covenant before the Nazis can get their hands on it. This is the type of movie where the adventure never stops. In the opening scene we see Indiana in South America. In that scene we see him escape a collapsing tomb, jump across a ditch, get shot at by arrows, get chased by a giant bolder, and then have a bunch of local natives chase him to his plane as he makes a narrow escape. That was only the opening scene. Later on in the movie we see him in a shootout in a bar in Mongolia, getting attacked by ninjas in Cairo, and several other perils such as a pit full of cobras, an airplane landing strip getting ready to explode, an exciting car chase, and so much more in his daring quest to find the ark of the covenant. Along with him are his friends Marion(Karen Allen) and Sallah(Lord Of The Rings's John Rhyse-Davies). Raiders Of The Lost Ark is the ultimate in genre defining action and has been copied many times, but has never been bettered."
5833,"Just a bunch of guys in suits...; Basically a werewolf version of Assault on Precinct 13 and similarly themed films. Here it's a couple of soldiers out on an training mission that are trapped in a cottage trying to fight off a bunch of savage canines. There are quite a few problems with Dog Soldiers. Firstly, it's a pretty low budget film, which isn't necessarily a problem, but here it's quite obvious (especially the werewolves, who look like stuffed wolf heads on stilts). Secondly, the story has been done many times before, and it follows the basic outline of the occupied building genre, which leads into point three - characterisation. There's no way to identify with the characters since they're pretty indistinguishable from another. At the end of the day, there just a bunch of guys (read cannon fodder) in fatigues getting picked off one at a time. The acting is decent, there's shooting and some blood, but Dog Soldiers never rises above being a cheap flick were the werewolves most of the time are on screen in the form of a rubbery arm with claws. One clever moment, though, - towards the end there's a funny line for those who've seen the Matrix. 2/10"
6373,"Illogical, but sometimes funny; I rarely get bothered by illogical events in movies, but this one has a few huge defects in that department. Where did the rest of the soup in the bowl go when Bruce did the split? And how come no one seemingly observed the moon being dragged towards earth? Such annoyances make ""Bruce Almighty"" just another average flick. As usual in an average Jim Carrey movie, it has a few very funny scenes. Like the rival anchor man contender being forced to talk nonsense and make funny faces (which is technically messing with free if you ask me, still funny though), the Jimmy Hoffa discovery and the Clint Eastwood imitation are all simply hilarious. These miniature Carrey-sketches saves the movie from being just totally ridiculous. None of the other actors make great appearances and the plot is more or less the blueprint of 10,000 other light Hollywood comedies. It gets sappy and uninspiring at the end too. Good enough for a lazy post party Sunday perhaps, but there are better Jim Carrey movies for that use."
1275,"Cult Classic; Whata great film. You have a Christopher Lambert as a Scotsman and Sean Connery as a Spaniard. That in itself explains only part of the movie. Whoever thought this up was onto a good thing. Great acting, great story, great scenery and terrible accents. But what a story it was of Mr. McLeod. Now my youngest son is named Conor (one n) but that is besides the point. The Highlands are a place dreams come true (not IOWA by the way). The Madison Square Garden bit at the start was exceptionally well done as I think was the opening statement. How many real die hard fans of this movie have forgotten the initial words ""from the dawn of time they came""? My favourite bit is when he is cradling his wife as she is dying in the Highlands and she asks for a candle to be lit on her birthday each year. Yes, soppy I know, but I liked it."
30812,"A pity this wasn't the extended edition; It seems that the Aviator is heading for Oscar glory this year, but if it does win I suspect it will be more of a nod to Scorsese's body of work. This is not to say that this is a bad film and it would have really deserved it's likely Oscar success had the majority of the first hour been saved for the extended edition DVD. The film focuses on the early years of Hughes especially his love of flying. His fight against mental illness is also dealt with and most people familiar with 20th century history will know where the story is leading. DiCaprio puts in a reasonable performance in the lead and is well supported by the rest of the cast including the excellent John C Reilly. Once the film gets into stride it's gripping during the second act. If you turn up for the screening about 45 minutes late you'll see a really excellent film."
1805,"Well-Executed, Well Acted, Interesting Story; Based on the trailers, I expected this to be a low-budget, B-movie that showed off the anatomies of pretty girls - not that that is entirely bad - but I do expect more from a movie. In actuality, this is a very, very good plot that is executed well by the principal actors. Neve Campbell, Denise Richards (surprisingly), and especially Matt Dillion turn in very good performances. I always enjoy Bill Murray and his part in this movie, although fairly small, adds some levity. I can't comment too much on this movie without spoiling it, except to say that things aren't always what they expect to be. There are a lot of plot twists, some that probably couldn't stand tremendous scrutiny, but are realistic enough to keep the audience engaged. The other technical aspects of the movie - direction and cinematography - are done very well, too. That is, they are unobtrusive. This really is a thoroughly entertaining film, and while it does contain one rather steamy scene, is not a cheap sex film, but a well-thought out, well-executed story. I highly recommend it."
3163,"Allan Corduner; I have just watched Topsy Turvy for the second time and found it highly entertaining.The point has been made elsewhere about the rehearsal scenes which were very accurate and brought back memories of my directing episodes in the local village players group. However I would like to know if anyone can confirm that Allan Corduner was playing the piano properly in his role as Sir Arthur Sullivan. If he was pretending then he was doing a very good imitation. The quality of the singing was tremendous and I particularly liked the rendition of ""The Sun Whose Rays"" but unfortunately I failed to establish the name of the actress who gave this performance.So any info on this point would also be welcome"
5956,"A celebration of violence.; Violence can be absolutely fascinating. Scorsese knows this all too well. Look back at his career and you can see some of the most malevolent behavior captured on film. Gangs of New York plays out like a big; colorful orgy of despicable characters doing rotten things in a truly wicked environment. There are lags in the action to be sure, and there are at least attempts at character development, but when it's finally over, all you're likely to remember is the violence. Or perhaps you'll still be in awe of Daniel Day-Lewis, as I was. And why not? His character was the most violent. Gangs of New York is a film that cannot figure out what it's really about. It's about a lot of things, but there seems to be an absence of any central theme or idea. Is it about a young man scheming about getting revenge for his father's murder? Sometimes. Is it about the struggle between early immigrant gangs and gangs of people born in the USA? Sometimes. Is it about political corruption? Sometimes. Is it about draft riots during the civil war, and the Union's inability to convince people who hate blacks to die for them? Sometimes. There are also scenes dedicated to fire brigades, stealing from rich people, and public hangings, too. Only in the film's final scenes does it attempt to bring all of these things together. I'll grant Scorsese the benefit of the doubt and tell the world he did a fine job of depicting how violent New York was during the 19th century. If his film was trying to tell me something more, I guess I missed it. So sayeth the Hound."
55926,"for those from areas with oilfields it is a reminder; You know, maybe it wasn't the all time best movies, but it is is one of the only attempts to make a movie about a real life hero- Red Adair. It was something that people in parts of the country where you have seen a rig burn for a month while they try to put it out, where family members or friends have died in oil rig disasters, the movie gave life to the names that they have heard, to see what these men do and fall in love with this hard knocking, hard living, danger loving men. It is a reminder of what they face.. and in that, it makes it a good movie. John Wayne is reunited with Bruce Cabot and the movie is not the best of both actors, nor the worst. The character that John Wayne plays is typically strong with a character flaw, like so many men in this world. I like that fact that it is a G rated movie, like so many from that era, it is a movie that I can let my children watch and not worry about violence( by todays standards), sex, or any of those things."
2165,"The scene with the three men; One of the most fascinating moments in this film is the scene in which the three men each tell about their most exciting sexual liaison. Jason Patric's anecdote is amazing, both as written and as acted. A virulent misogynist with no empathy for the women he has used sexually, he tells a story in which a bunch of jocks, including him, rape a homosexual to show what contempt they have for him. The Patric character is last in line and in describing his encounter with the abused rapee, he expresses more than a deep empathy for the victim, but in fact something like respect and love. The implications inherent in his anecdote have kept on resonating for me ever since, but the capper to it all is how powerfully Patric tells the story. I wouldn't particularly want to re-see the rest of the movie, but I could watch that scene again and again. Why is Patric so underrated? He was also very good in Incognito."
31221,"Elektra-fying? I think not. But not a disappointment either. A decent comic book flick, that needed to be made.; Having cheated death as a target of Bullseye in Daredevil, Elektra survives with, I can guess, emotional scars. But in her nightmares the persistent image that haunts her is that the death of her mother in an idyllic white bedroom, and the fleeting glimpse of her slayer. This, it appears, is one of the things that keeps her going, one of the things that likely propelled her to become an assassin for hire; an assassin so good that among those who have witnessed her at work her image has ascended to a somewhat mythical status. It's nice to be so highly thought of. The movie begins with what I believe is its most impressive moment, and one of the most brilliant sequences in recent comic book films, a fine introduction at that. A crime boss sits alone having a drink, waiting, instinctively knowing he's Elektra's target. Resigned to the inevitable, he tells one of his henchmen exactly how she goes about her business and why he's still alive after a prior encounter. In his case, for optimum effect, the thought of death is even worse when you know, without question, it's coming. He now realizes this was her intent. And like the stories he has heard, he expects she'll whisper in his ear before she kills him. The scene does Elektra's myth good. I'd like to say the same for the rest of the movie, but beyond this point it's more like a depletion of the myth, at least from the audience's standpoint. Elektra's right-hand man informs her that her next assignment is a cash windfall and certainly worth the take, so they gear up and go for it. She commences the first part of the assignment: relocating for a couple months to a sparsely populated island. The house itself is an impressive piece of architecture. And there she prepares, waits for further directions. To no one's surprise there's a workout montage, during which I'll note that she does one-handed pull-ups. I'm not sure if Rocky ever did that. That scene was particularly hot. Lol. A young girl, Abby breaks into Elektra's house and is about to endure her wrath. Then again, she didn't know an assassin was taking up residence there, so she did find it surprising to have her shirt sleeve nailed to the wall by a box opener. Abby, it turns out, lives nearby with her father, Mark, and she wouldn't mind at all if Elektra and he got to know each other a little better. And wouldn't you know it, it's after they get to know each other a little that Elektra's second directive arrives, her target is Abby and Mark. And, she's not down with that. Not down with it at all. Killing them would have been easy, but keeping an eye on them becomes even tougher. Abby, you see, has a talent for fighting that's already almost on par with Elektra, and the renegade group known as the Hand wants her for their own. Elektra, of course, won't have that either. So what transpires is an effort by Elektra to protect Abby from abduction. The bad guy, Kirigi's group of killers are introduced. Tattoo, Stone and Typhoid They're an intriguing lot. Unfortunately we don't really get to know anything about them. It's a parade of undeveloped characters. Thus their interactions with Elektra are essentially hollow, entertaining if only through the demonstration of their powers. The fight scenes are neatly shot, and edited so quickly, and that of course is cool. But there must be something more than that. Even the final fight scene was uneventful enough to make me glance at my watch. The film lacks any real action that it could have, and should have been loaded to the gills with. I'm on par with this film along with Daredevil. Daredevil had problems with character development, which Elektra certainly has no problem with, but Elektra has problems with the action. There just isn't enough to keep anyone satisfied. That's to say it's a bad movie, it's not. But it's not a great movie either. It's just good It's pretty average and not worth recommending if you want action. To me, it is better than Daredevil. Gardner is perfect as Elektra. She's got the beauty, the acting, the skills, and oh yea, the beauty. Did I mention she's beautiful? It's worth a look if you want 90 minutes of wasting time, but you can something better to do with your 8 bucks. I for one enjoyed it. Sexy is as sexy does.... ***/*****"
5015,"Wow! Could they put any MORE drama in ONE movie?; I've seldom seen a film that impressed and fascinated me so much while watching it, but actually turned out a major disappointment after analyzing it afterwards. Throughout its entire playtime, Monster's Ball FEELS like a brilliant film but it leaves a gigantic empty feeling in your stomach when you come to think that the drama and the characters you felt so connected with are actually depth-less and unsupported. It is in fact praiseworthy that director Marc Foster manages to ""fool"" us during the whole film with utterly simply tricks, as you simply stare at the story's beauty and intensity with great respect and admiration without realizing it's totally fake sentiment you're witnessing. Monster's Ball basically has one trump that makes it all the more appealing for true film buffs: the entire production feels very anti-Hollywood! The tone quite unique and some of the subplots and character drawings are highly unlike to feature in a big production like this. Sober, depressing, modestand even though the story is highly unrealistic and far-fetched, you experience it as a true event simply because it's brought to you so well. Director Marc Foster patiently takes his time to come to the point what the movie actually is about (namely: the unusual force of attraction between a Southern white prison guard and an Afro-American mother whose husband was executed on the electric chair) but that is a sublimely elaborated element, as the viewer really feels that what drives the protagonists together is agony, loneliness and death. A lot of suffering takes place before Hank (Billy Bob Thornton) and Leticia (Hally Berry) finally find some consolation and hope with each other. Probably even a little too much, as I rarely some much bitterness featuring in one film. Now, what exactly is wrong with this picture? Because all the things I summed up so far only increase the suspicion that ""Monster's Ball"" is an excellent film and a must see for every self-respecting fan of cinema. Well, that's only half true. While the audience is developing sympathy and compassion for the characters' situations, the screenplay fails to enlighten why exactly you do so. I can easily state this with punctual examples but then  of course  you'll be reading huge SPOILERS! We're witnessing how a death row-condemned father (good performance by Sean Combs) is saying goodbye to his family and, although it's very sincere, you don't know whether this sequence is justified. What has he done? Does he even deserve forgiveness? Same goes for the painful relation between the embittered prison guard and his emotionally unstable son Sonny (Heath Ledger). Their interactions are cold and aggressive but not once you're given feedback on what exactly caused this. The abrupt ending of this subplot fills you up (whether immediately or afterwards) with disappointment because you feel the sentiment is exploited and the matter could have been arranged in a different way. There are more examples to state that ""Monster's Ball' lacks depth but I suggest you see for yourself. Still, I too wish to recommend this film to as many people as possible. Only not for the obvious argument that the story is heart-breaking but simply because it's a professionally shot film. Especially Roberto Schaefer's cinematography is outstanding and shows you camera-angles of which you didn't know they existed. The acting also deserves all the praise it can get. Halle Berry does a fine job but at times it feels like she's hankering too anxiously after her Oscar. If there's anyone here who should have won an Oscar for his performance, it's Billy Bob Thornton but the members of the Academy shamelessly make a rule out of overlooking this brilliant actor. Worth mentioning as well is the remarkable role of Peter Boyle as Thornton's ultra-racist dad. This fine veteran actor did his best work back in the seventies, with movies like ""Hardcore"", ""F.I.S.T"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" on his repertoire."
8861,"Action. Chicks. Guns. What more is there?; If you've found yourself obeying the critics and twiddling your thumbs through such movies as 'Lost in Translation' and 'The Hours' (yah, OK, so they had ""character development"" and ""plots""..hmmm, maybe that's why they were so boring...), then treat your mind to some kick-ass action sequences (and NO character development! I promise!) in 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse.' No ""profound"" suicides over sweeping scores, no ""bold"" performances, no ""life-altering"" themes. (Thank god). Just pure, heart-pounding sci-fi action. Here's to Resident Evil 3. Bring it on. ****/****"
30894,"What happened, Michael Keaton?; Remember when Michael Keaton was awesome? He must be getting some pretty horrible scripts these days if this is the one he settled on. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. I'm sitting in the theater thinking to myself over and over ""Who cares!?!"" 1. Don't care about the characters 2. Don't care what's happening 3. Don't care what's going to happen A few cheap jumps. That's it. Terrible writing and terrible direction. A lot of the story didn't make sense, and you just aren't invested enough in the characters or the plot to bother with the brain power to figure it out. You know you're in a bad movie when the whole theater is laughing out loud at stuff that's supposed to be serious or scary. 2 out of 10."
5990,"If you survive 15 minutes of Benigni, it's really a good movie; Roberto Begnini at 50 as wooden child Pinochio is really a torture. When I saw yesterday in cable, the first 15 minutes I've only think change the channel. Fortunately in my heart I knew that If I waited some that time I will find a nice movie. After that I've started to enjoy and Roberto started to be less annoying. After all it was a movie of a Clown in a portray of a wooden Lier. Then the movie was very nice, with a great cinematography, costumes, recreation and all the things that money can buy, a wonderful cast (specially Kim Rossi Stuart and Nicholetta Braschi as the Fata Azurra)and most important of all a wonderful story. The story has 3 points in favour. 1) All the children are actually adults. 2) Pinochio is really an bad educated, annoying and impulsive boy (probably is Colodi real toy, much less sweet that Disney Picture) 3) Benigni shows a moral lesson to all the free spirits boys, they though that they will doctors, advocates said one of the villains reference to the dessobey boys. And that is all the idea of doing that movie. Maybe with Jim Carrey or Robin Williams the picture in U.S.A. earn more money. However the comunication between Benigni and the children is a breath when all the American movie for children implicates words like Coca Cola, Computer or Mc Donalds."
8981,"If you live in the Bible belt stay home; Many people have complained about the graphic nature of this film. While i will admit, the language is vulgar and obscene, the movie ratings system warns of it. Coming from a very conservative area i would recommend if you are easily offended by language and conversations that are very sexually graphic, you should stay home. That said, the film was extremely well made, with terrific performances by the whole cast. Natalie Portman really proves herself to be a terrific actress in this film, and combined with last year's Garden State she has really grown into a very mature, very talented actress, and i don't think the next Star Wars will be able to ruin that. Julia Roberts also delivers a strong performance, as a very un-Julia character. Normally i do not like her work because she doesn't seem to play different characters, but in this film she definitely broke my expectations. On to the men, Jude law and Clive Owen. Both delivered amazing performances. I have seen a lot of both men's films and i truly think this one may be the highlight of both's careers thus far. Mike Nichols follows up Angels in America with another well made film. In the slew of films about adultery that have come out beginning in the end of 2004, with We don't live here Anymore, Closer proves to be the best yet"
8917,No surprises here; If you see a trailer of this film you'll know exactly what to expect. The film sends up everything to do with American life. The liberals suffer at the hands of the puppets in the same way that the conservatives suffer. It will undoubtedly be the most politically incorrect film of the year. The humour is pure playground humour and even though you know you really shouldn't find it that funny you can't help but laugh. It's quite fashionable to make references to other films nowadays and you'll find plenty of that here. Don't expect to much of a plot and watch out for the best vomit scene since the Exorcist.
153404,"The First Frontal Nude Scene in the Brazilian Cinema, In a Nouvelle-Vague Film; Jandir (Jece Valadão) and Vavá (Daniel Filho) are two scums and small time crooks from Copacabana, who want to raise some easy money shooting compromising pictures of Leda (Norma Bengell) and blackmailing her rich uncle. Leda convinces them to use her cousin Vilma (Lucy de Carvalho), the daughter of the victim. ""Os Cafajestes"" is one of the most important Brazilian films ever. This was the first movie made in Brazil by director Rui Guerra, from Mozambique, in the beginning of the Brazilian movement ""Cinema Novo"" (New Cinema), raised against the Brazilian ""pornochanchada"" (very silly comedies with great popular appeal). ""Os Cafajestes"" is totally influenced by the Nouvelle-Vague and is very daring, presenting the first frontal nude scene in the Brazilian cinema, with Norma Bengell naked for about four minutes. The story is very amoral, and the film was completely mutilated by the producer, due to the censorship of the government and the Catholic Church. Therefore, there are gaps along the story, and consequently the characters are not well developed. Further, I regret that this important film has not had a decent distribution. My VHS, horribly recorded in LP, was released by ""Isto É"", and the image does not stop scrolling and the sound in some parts makes almost impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking. There are only thirty-seven votes in IMDb, meaning that there is no worldwide distribution of this movie. I feel sorry for the overseas movie lovers, not having the chance to know such a film. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): ""Os Cafajestes"" (""The Scums"")"
912,"The Fundamental Things Apply...; ""Casablanca"" remains Hollywood's finest moment, a film that succeeds on such a vast scale not because of anything experimental or deliberately earthshaking in its design, but for the way it cohered to and reaffirmed the movie-making conventions of its day. This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness. It's the first week in December, 1941, and in the Vichy-controlled African port city of Casablanca, American ex-pat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls ""Rick's Cafe Americaine."" Everybody comes to Rick's, including thieves, spies, Nazis, partisans, and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and, eventually, America. Rick is a tough, sour kind of guy, but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists: A pair of unchallengeable exit visas, and a woman named Ilsa who left him broken-hearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistance-leader husband escape. Humphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa, in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides, very multilayered and resistant to stereotype, and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him, while she wants him to understand her cause, but there's a lot going on underneath with both, and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments. ""Casablanca"" is a great romance, not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realistic-though-exotic wartime excitement, but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar, or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris: ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years. For me, and many, the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault, the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism, one-liners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor, as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival. But there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music, or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband, but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates, and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa, a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him, is something to wonder at. My favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is ""trustworthy,"" and that, if she does ""a bad thing"" to secure her husband's happiness, it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa, suppresses a grimace, tries to buy the woman off with a one-liner (""Go back to Bulgaria""), then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself. It's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles, but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz, who not only directed this film but other great features like ""Captain Blood"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces."" For my money, his ""Adventures Of Robin Hood"" was every bit ""Casablanca's"" equal, and he even found time the same year he made ""Casablanca"" to make ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" When you watch a film like this, you aren't so much aware of the director, but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. ""Casablanca"" is not only exceptionally well-paced but incredibly well-shot, every frame feeling well-thought-out and legendary without distracting from the overall story. Curtiz was a product of the studio system, not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin, but he found greatness just as often, and ""Casablanca,"" also a product of the studio system, is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations, and why we call it ""the dream factory."" As the hawker of linens tells Ilsa at the bazaar, ""You won't find a treasure like this in all Morocco."" Nor, for that matter, in all the world."
7458,"Ostentatious Garbage; This is an epic picture. There isn't a moment in this movie where the director, actors, writer or the musical score let you forget it. Sadly, it a very poor epic. The dialog is pretentious posturing and war-mongering. Many times in the movie, our great, god-like hero, Brad Pitt, speaks and the crowd cheers. Utter garbage. There are wholly implausible moments in a movie that is attempting a very realistic presentation. There is a scene where Brad Pitt lops the head off a gold-plated, stone (or perhaps solid gold) statue like it was made of butter. This can work in a movie that is a fantasy or supernatural epic, but it was inconsistent with the timbre of this movie. The acting from very good actors is consistently bad. I like Brad Pitt. He is an exceptionally talented actor (just see ""12 Monkeys"" for proof of that). This movie made him look like a pretty-boy B movie actor, which he worked so hard to avoid early in his career. The director of this movie, Wolfgang Peterson, has to take the blame for this. He failed to execute on a very good, well-known story. Even the score of this movie was pompous and intrusive. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The best part is the special effects, but that is no where close to being sufficient to save this dog."
6373,"God awful; Local-TV man Carrey thinks he's treated badly by everyone, and lashes out against his co-workers, girlfriend, and God. He just can's accept the fact that he's an absolute bastard living a pretty nice life. Enter God, who teaches him a lesson about life by letting Bruce (Carrey) temp for him while he's off on vacation. Hilarity ensues. Bruce Almighty is essentially a mix of previous Carrey films Liar, Liar and The Mask. If you've seen those two, you can pretty much guess what's coming. Most of the time, Almighty is a horribly bad film. Carrey's manic tantrums and crazy antics were never that funny to begin with, and by now it's been done to death. The film is divided up into three parts: An introduction where we get to know (and hate) Bruce, a middle part where Bruce has fun with his powers, and a third part, where Bruce learns the errors of his ways and becomes a better person. The beginning is bad, the middle has some fun bits, and the end is half an hour of excruciating torture. Instead of entertaining, the film raises some questions. Does anybody want to see this kind of sappy endings, where the protagonist gets a moral education in order to become a better human being? What made Aniston's character Grace (see what they did with her name there?) fall in love with Bruce in the first place? Why are the effects so cheap looking? How much money did Morgan Freeman get to sign on for this mess? It's doubtful that this film would have been made if Carrey hadn't starred in it. It's just not funny. On an ending note, and for future reference - any screenplay that includes such ""hilarious"" catch phrases as ""B-E-A-utiful"" or ""Good, gooood"" should be burned. 2/10"
8970,"The Mind, Heart, and Muses that Created Peter Pan; Finding Neverland tells the remarkable story behind J.M. Barrie's creation of Peter Pan for the London stage in the early 1900s. The movie focuses on the beautiful friendship that develops between J.M. Barrie, a widow Sylvia, and her four young sons, and how that friendship opens the heart and inspires the writing of Mr. Barrie. What I really loved about this movie was the artful way scenes from J.M. Barrie's friendship with the Davies family and scenes depicting the imagination of Mr. Barrie were woven together with details of the Peter Pan story itself. The movie works such magic on the screen. Johnny Depp gives a superb performance as the imaginative and charming Mr. Barrie, and he brings out the best qualities of the child actors as well. This movie touched me as both a parent and a writer, and I highly recommend it."
4558,"Beautiful film; This was a great film. The story is of a man (Julius Benedict, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) who grows up on a tropical island with a scientist, and knows nothing of modern society. Then one day he finds out he has a twin brother in L.A. He was also told that his mother died giving birth to him and his brother. When he gets to L.A. he finds his brother, who appears to be nothing like him, sort of an opposite person entirely, although they share some things in common. Julius is very pleasant, sensible, intelligent, Vincent, his brother, is a petty car thief and always getting into trouble. Julius goes looking for where their mother lived and finds she is gone. He finds one of his 6 fathers, but not his mother. He is given an address in New Mexico to find a scientist who was at his birth. (Julius was part of a secret govt experiment to produce a superhuman man). He goes with his brother Vincent to find the scientist, who tells them their mother is alive and well and living near Santa Fe. So they go off looking for her, find her but don't realise it, as she thinks they are tricking her. She was lied to as well, being told that her son was dead, and nothing about the twin son who was born 1 minute later. Add to that some villains chasing the brothers as Vincent is driving a stolen car with a secret jet engine stored in the back, and some comedy along the way, and some magnificent scenery along the way. I thought the relationship between the two twins was great, very well done, and believable. What they said about being a family was very moving. And at the end it all works out well. An excellent film about relationships, family, and what is important in life, and about how to do the right thing, when at the end the twins do the right thing and get rewarded. I recommend this film. If you view it as a violent movie about beating the criminals, it can work on that level, if you view it as a comedy it is quite good too, but as a film about family and relationships is where it really works best, view this with an open heart."
34045,"Brilliant; ""The I Inside"" is an excellent psychological thriller which will linger with you days after you see it. Simon (Ryan Phillippe) wakes up in a hospital with no memory of how he got there and no memory of the last two years of his life. Early on he meets Claire, whom he doesn't remember and Anna, a wife he doesn't know he had. Simon is also not aware his brother Peter is dead. The last thing Simon remembers is that he went to see his brother in 2000 and that he had an auto accident that evening. Thus begins a tale of past and present as Simon relives the experiences of 2000 and 2002, discovering along the way he can change change past and present. Some have compared this to ""Memento,"" but the story is really closer in spirit to an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode, titled ""Shadow Play"" and the play ""Steambath,"" with touches of ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" though lacking the emotional wallop or terror of the others. Nonetheless, ""The I Inside"" is a great psychological suspense film and I highly recommend it. WARNING: SPOILERS Some seem confused about the nature of Mr. Travati, Simon's wisecracking hospital roommate"" and the reason for the ""2002"". Simon saw ""Mr. Travati"" walking down the passageway of the hospital, hooked to an IV bottle, when he was brought after the car accident. Simon is DEAD, and his conscious integrated Travati, Anna and the emergency room doctors into his illusion, in order to give cohesiveness to the illusion that he was still alive and experiencing ""time travel."" The ""2002"" was actually 20:02, military time (8:02 PM), when the emergency room doctor called Simon's death. END OF SPOILERS This movie was released directly to cable, where, fortunately, there should be a big audience for it. I predict ""The I Inside"" will become a cult film and is certainly worthy of a ""9""."
30707,"Moving; This bare, emotional movie is the best that Eastwood has ever done in my opinion. For me, it's not because it has a ruthless, touching ending. So many people have written about it better than I can. I loved this movie because of the atmosphere that Eastwood created. The movie had a lot of stretches. For me, the story line is too fantastical. It's hard to imagine that a prized fighter would train in such a run-down decrepit old gym. Isn't it a coincidence that two exceptional fighters would both come out of the same gym seemingly in the middle of nowhere, white trash America? But this movie was so realistic in its dialog that I forgot about all that. You could smell the sweat in that gym and it had such a homey feel to it, it made you believe that people would spend all day there. This is a character movie with fantastic actors who did it justice. Why isn't anyone talking about giving Morgan Freeman a nomination?"
6142,"Crummy; The year is 1982. A strange mummy is discovered in the tomb of King Tut, apparently having been overlooked by Howard Carter the first time around. When the bandage-wrapped dude arrives at the California Institute of the Sciences, it is up to Ben Murphy, his stoned looking girlfriend and a team of badly dressed losers to examine him. When a dorky jerk discovers a handful of crystals inside the sarcophagus, he decides to steal them for money. Unfortunately, the mummy wakes up and goes looking for his crystals, which have been spread all over campus in the form of bracelets and necklaces. Everyone the mummy touches is consumed by a killer green fungus and dies, if they're not killed outright by the cranky mummy. The mummy stumbles his way through boiler rooms, drunken frat parties, terrorizes a naked girl in the shower and another fully dressed one in a library. Turns out the mummy is an alien, and he needs those crystals to get back to his own planet. What a lifeless, unenthusiastic mess this film is. Everyone looks half asleep and not particularly interested in the stupid film they were making. Horror enthusiasts might appreciate the presence of horror veteran James Karen and ""Motel Hell"" heroine Nina Axelrod is here too, playing the soggy, vapid love interest. Other than that, there is really no reason whatsoever to see this movie. It's boring, repetitive and ugly."
4411,"yesterday not today; The Sons of Katie Elder probably is a fair representation of what life in the old west was like, OK, not exactly, but people have to remember that not only can you not judge this movie by the mores and ethics of today's society ( 2005) but you also can not judge what men where like in the old west. It was a hard life and frontier justice and frontier life was not a picnic. Men lived by the gun and died by the gun. It was the biggest, toughest, most guns that defended the land, not in the movies, but in real life. This movie portrays simply a family that came apart, due to the same things that tear families apart today, alcohol,gambling, differences of opinion, and pride. It also shows humanity at its worst and at its best. Judge the movie not on today's standards but on what history tells us life was like."
2133,"A really sweet and innocent comedy about a girl who babysits but has to take a tour downtown.; This is a really funny movie because you never really know where it's going. Basically everything that happens in it happens by accident. It's not only funny but also exciting if you aren't that old. I think it's great. It sort of reminds me about ""Afterhours"" (starring Griffin Dunne) but this is the family version of that movie. Anything can happen during a crazy night or so it seems. Elisabeth Shue is good in this movie and everyone in it seems to have had a good time making it. If you just want to see a cute movie which makes you feel good , or if you've had enough of over-dramatic epics , action that blows you out of your seat and bloody horror movies , check this out. It's sweet , funny , lovable and adventurous all at the same time. If you don't like it , there are more than enough of violence out there for you."
27170,"Average horror with some nice twists; ** HERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS ** Life is complicated when you're in high school, but it becomes even worse when a killer seems to target high school kids. Jody (Murphy) is the daughter of the towns sheriff Brent Marken (Biehn). She also has some problem with her boyfriend that wants to ""do more"" than she wants. The sheriff together with the school principal (Inscoe) tries to keep the situation in control, and Jody turns to her parents and teacher (Mohr) for support. But then the rumor reaches the youth that the killer targets virgins only, and then there is only one way to protect oneself. A huge party is set up, and boys and girls start to pair up. But there are dark secrets about... Not the best movie ever made but sufficient to entertain for a night. A little suspense, a lot of blood and a mix of sex violence and betrayal. There are some nice ideas, twists and turns in the plot mixed up with some more implausible parts. Put together the movie never gets stale, but some scenes one can watch with only one eye. Good but not stellar actor performances but some nice characters. Well... that about sums my comment up I think... 5/10"
592,"Burton At His Best; Tim Burtons 'Batman' is one of the finest superhero movies ever made. Attempting to re-create a comic book legend is no mean feat in itself, but pulling it off is nothing short of remarkable. Batman achieves the crossover with excellent visual effects and on-screen performances. Jack Nicholson is particularly noteworthy, as the sadistic, yet hilarious Joker character, and Michael Keaton is undoubtedly the most convincing Batman(Clooney was a laughing stock) The storyline isn't anything knew. Jack Napier, a hood working for Gotham crime boss Carl Grissom, becomes 'Joker' after falling into acid, at a chemical plant...At the hands, of course, of caped crusader Batman! Joker seeks revenge, and a war ensues, with Bruce Wayne love interest Vicky Vale smack in the middle. In short, an excellent good versus. evil story, with great acting all round."
6587,"Sexiest Line in a movie that I myself have seen.; Wow... J-Lo's speech about the 'mouth' was breath taking. I think that is one of thee most sexiest parts in a movie I have ever seen. Well, the Titanic parts were pretty good too, but J-Lo speaks the truth, and tells it pretty well. You can sense Ben character is just shocked, and mind blown listening to her speak. Having the great body she has, and all that yoga in the middle, just adds on, making it even more sexier. The finger nails thing, that was pretty funny, Ben was trying to cover it all up. Shout out to all my people, this is old school, love that kid. I wonder if he got to make it with that Aussie chick."
8972,"A cracking good movie that shows some of Nick Cages hidden talents; I went to see this thinking that I knew Nicolas Cage and did not like his work. I came out madly in love, excited and stunned by this film. In my opinion the script could have been a Lara Croft vehicle.However, Nick Cage was outstanding. The storyline was intelligent, as was the script. Yes, there are holes (150 yr old torches that light immediately!) but the chemistry between the characters and the sheer imagination of the whole, creates forgiveness from the viewer. I have seen this film twice, once with my husband and once with the children. My 6 year old enjoyed it on one level, my 9 yr old on another and as devotees of books like The Holy Blood and The Holy Grail, my husband and I were impressed by detail. This is the story The Da Vinci Code, SHOULD have been. Nicholas Cage is simply fantastic and incredibly FUNNY, a side of him rarely seen. In some ways I hope there is no sequel - the story is so self contained, but somehow, I feel perhaps Oak Island Moneypit may be beckoning in the background . . . ."
7646,"Creepy, but overly long ghost story....; Well, another Stephen King book gets turned into a mini series, hence the four hour running time. While it was creepy, this film could have been done in two hours. I did not see the need for this to become a mini series. Rose Red is a house that was built at the turn of the century by a rich mogul as a wedding gift to his wife. From the start, there were strange deaths and occurrences surrounding the house. The house is to keep being built, until Ellen, the wife of the mogul, tells it to stop. Since she dies before she has a chance to say it is finished, the house keeps building itself. Years later, a group of psychic's enter into the house, to prove that the strange occurrences that happened in it's troubled past, have to do with the supernatural. There were definitely some creepy moments in this mini series, but again, I stress that it was too long. The African slave girl freaked me out every time she came on screen, with her wide open eyes, and not to mention the daughter April with the withered left hand. I would like to see more mini series made out of Stephen King books, but maybe HBO can do them, so that we get more horror, and not watered down horror made for network television. For fans of Stephen King, they will definitely love this film. Others, will find it overlong, and somewhat boring at times. I'll stick to Poltergeist, still the scariest ghost story ever put on film."
30816,"Joel Schumacher, Peter Jackson, and Redemption; Prior to the filming of The Frighteners (and even including it, in the opinion of the author), Peter Jackson was considered to be a sub-par, B-Movie director, directing works such as ""Meet the Feebles"", ""Bad Taste"", and ""Heavenly Creatures"" - all poor works with weak cinematography and ridiculous plot lines, ignoring all Elements of Drama, saving Spectacle. However, a certain conglomeration of mistakes educated Mr. Jackson in the important technical aspects of filmcraft, aspects that separate poorly executed films with good intentions (i.e. ""Meet the Feebles"") from truly inspirational and quality films. These mistakes, staging, filmographic, and literary, become necessary for directors with weak educations and lack of experience. However, an ultimate benefit comes to the director from these embarrassments; it turns them into genius filmmakers. A parallel can be drawn between Peter Jackson and Joel Schumacher, in this sense. Schumacher's ""blockbuster"" movies, most notably ""Batman & Robin"" reek of weakness, containing few truly significant moments, and, in the case of ""Batman & Robin"", have great intentions of making profound statements about masculinity that are dismissed because of poor execution. This in mind, the author believes that ""Phantom of the Opera"" should be considered to be Schumacher's ""Frighteners"". Though ""Phantom"" has acting weaknesses and a noticeably low-voiced Phantom, the cinematography and design are superb. Costume design and visual design coordinates well to show the duality of the Phantom and Raoul. In addition, the sound design inspires in one's mind an empty opera house, or cave where there are lurking, death-obsessed spirits. Though some would credit the actual sound and costume and visual designers for this beauty, the coordination of those arts into a single, coherent structure is the responsibility of the director, and, through this responsibility, Joel Schumacher performs beautifully."
69231,"Delightful, simple, worth it.; The movie has a combination of elements: lots of humor, a little suspense, and a little action. This is about life in a rural Polish town and how it is run not by the mayor, or the police chief, but the priest. There is a heart-warming ""boy meets girl"" element. The title, an old idiom which translates to ""safe and comfortable"" really says it all, but the funny and harried action in the film certainly is not as peaceful as the title might imply. What is really amazing is that most of the cast is from the Bialystok Puppet Theater, and for most of the actors, this is their one an only movie. My thumb is up! Enjoy!"
8981,"It's not supposed to be entertaining!; I expect this film will be more appreciated in England than in US. I live in London and saw it last night, 20 hours ago. Didn't know if I liked it or not. But....can't stop thinking about it. So many layers, so many themes (as in American Beauty) but 'Closer is much cleverer. No emotion, deliberately. It's an intellectual piece about the human condition. It's a play. You don't go to see Closer to just enjoy a 'movie.' I actively avoid anything with Julia Roberts in cos it'll be bland sugary crap. Having her in this is to entice a few more people in. Must be lots who hate it/walk out. Quite funny really!! Everything in the film is 'meant. Very manufactured. Even the jobs they do are to suit the play's themes:-Obituarist who makes up euphemisms. Photographer who 'steals peoples's lives.' Dermatoligist who presumably thinks things are only 'skin deep.' Stripper...... Basically if you're not the type of person who thinks deeply about things then you won't like this film. My sister likes things like 'Stepmom.!!!!' I despair."
7254,"Original and entertaining; This is certainly an excellent film. It's strengths are originality and an intelligent script that really makes you think. It's quite a relief to be free from all the formulaic nonsense that Hollywood usually pumps out. The plot centres around a young man (Evan) who finds he can go back in time and change history but gets more than he bargains for. This sort of plot is a minefield but the film pulls it off pretty well. There are a few minor holes in the plot (well if he knew that then why didn't he...) but it didn't really detract from the story at all. The plot is also less than subtle at times, never completely over the top but some of the events could have been a bit less extreme. The acting is fine. Some people here have commented on the casting but I didn't have any problems with it, in fact I thought the characters were generally pretty good. So I guess I'd give this an 8/10. It loses one point for lack of subtlety and one for (possibly impossible to fill) plot holes."
4388,"A very poor and lackluster effort.; The unexpected success of ""Scary Movie"" demanded an immediate sequel and all the Wayans' brothers could come up with was this uninspired, irritating story that (attempts to) spoof Haunted House horror films such as the ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""the Haunting"". Part two was released only a good 10 months after the original and this clearly resulted in a hack job that never should have come out. Apart from a bearable intro, in which a deranged James Woods performs a wacky exorcism, ""Scary Movie 2"" is nothing but a dreadful series of unfunny jokes, exaggerated graphics and gags that show no insight in the wonderful genre of horror. The complete cast returns and a few fresh ones are introduced (like the sexy Kathleen Robertson and the tasteless Tori Spelling) for spending a couple of nights in an ancient mansion where spirits dwell, cats become kick-boxers and the indoor plants smoke pot. Tim Curry, once the star of cult-classics, lowers himself to playing the horny college professor. This film is vulgar, tasteless and very offensiveyet, I couldn't care less about that! It's not funny and that's pretty bad for a supposedly hilarious parody/comedy. Avoid in case you've got some brain capacity left!"
1203,"Character study in a small jury room.; This movie, currently ranked as #21 all time on the IMDb list, is a simple story of the deliberations of 12 men on a jury of a murder trial. We see nothing of the actual trial or the closing arguments. The story begins as the judge instructs the jury, in weighing the evidence presented, they must return a verdict of 'guilty' unless there is reasonable doubt. Although not made clear in the movie, a verdict of ""not guilty"" is not the same as 'innocent.' Not guilty simply means that the prosecution did not present a case strong enough to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The case that we do not see or hear of first hand involves a son accused of murdering his father. One witness was an elderly man who claimed to have seen the boy running down the stairs from the apartment a few seconds after hearing voices and a body hitting the floor. Was this old man who shuffled along really able to get there in time? Could he really hear clearly over the noise of the passing train? Another was a woman who identified the boy as the one plunging the knife into the victim. But did she wear glasses, and did she have them on when she claimed she saw the murder 60 feet away through the windows of a passing train on elevated tracks (the 'el')? First seated the jurors take a vote, and it is 11 to one in favor of conviction. There is a ball game that evening and many of the men are anxious to delivered a verdict and get home. One man (Henry Fonda) says he is not sure, the boy may in fact be guilty, but suppose he isn't. He just wants to talk about it. A boy's life is at stake. Don't they owe it to him to examine all possibilities? But the other 11 at first look upon their task as one to convince the lone juror that he is wrong. As the 90 minutes move along, various jurors bring up points that they noticed, possibilities that neither the prosecution nor the defense attorneys had brought up. Others gradually join the 'not guilty' side, until it is only one for 'guilty.' Then there were none. Much of the dialog brought out prejudices certain men held, that were clouding their reasoning, and preventing them from seeing both sides of the argument. This is a story less about jury verdicts, and more about human nature. The movie sets out to show that with reasonable doubt at hand, a verdict of 'not guilty' must be returned. Thus it is mostly an examination of how our personal prejudice can cloud our judgment. I suspect that this story was much more significant 50 years ago than it is today. There have been a number of very public trials (e.g. OJ Simpson) where most of the evidence appeared to point to guilt, but a jury returned a 'not guilty' verdict because of reasonable doubt. However it remains part of the foundation of our legal system, that a person is innocent until proved guilty, even if it means some guilty persons will go free. Although only Lee J. Cobb stands out, as the angry juror who was the last hold out, this contained a fine ensemble cast. Martin Balsam, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Ed Begley are others who are prominent in my mind."
2948,"Not quite the best, but almost...; It boasts so much élan that this second James Bond film should be the best but somehow isn't quite. A tall, muscular Sean Connery is at his most dourly authoritative, Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya are heavyweight villains, Daniela Bianchi is a beautiful and vulnerable heroine, and the 'Hitchcockian' plot - based on Ian Fleming's best novel  is appropriately Byzantine. Yet it's probably the most dated of the Bond series. With its Balkan intrigue, gypsy-girl fights and Orient Express setting this is the one Bond film that might have been made in the 50s  except its violence and sexual charge could only belong to the permissive 60s. The vicious fight between Connery and Shaw in the cramped train compartment is a tour de force of editing (Peter Hunt) and still one of the best fight-sequences in the entire series (and in cinema). The first encounter between a near-naked Connery and Bianchi in Bond's hotel-room has a cool but electric daring, with a hint of kinkiness when we find Lenya filming them via a two-way mirror. It's certainly director Terence Young's best film. Ted Moore's Technicolor photography is as anonymously superb as always, making almost every camera set-up count in establishing the Istanbul location. Look how creatively Young, Moore (and Hunt) use light and space in staging the rendezvous in the St Sophia mosque, for example. John Barry took over as composer here and the music is so much more wittier, really making the action more three-dimensional, from the damp, sinister piano chords that warn of SPECTRE, to the mocking trumpet that underscores Shaw on the train stalking Connery on the station platform. Unlike later Bonds, From Russia with Love is a real film; the makers aren't yet spoofing themselves. Even the small parts here  SPECTRE's reptilian planner Kronsteen, Bulgarian hit-man Crilencu, gypsy-chief Vavra - are played with real conviction. Apart from 007's exploding attaché-case (the first of Q's gadgets), it's the only Connery-Bond to be uninterested in technology. Perhaps that's what stops it being the definitive one. Never mind; the producers got the balance perfect in Goldfinger the following year."
8132,"Better than a 5.5; First of all, this rating is ridiculous. I remember watching Gladiator when it first came out on video and now a few times on television. No it won't win any Oscars and it's not a dramatic masterpiece but it's never boring and moves along nicely. The fight scenes are entertaining, the chemistry between Marshall and Cuba is there, and the majority of the characters are developed. The only thing that fails is the love story, but I guess every film with teens has to have one. As far as people complaining about Marshall's wooden performance, I personally liked it. Not everyone is a charismatic, everyone is drawn to me type of person. He played it low-key, brooding, quiet, somewhat anti-social and it worked. If a film like this was made today, it would be a dumbed-down PG-13 version critics would probably love because it tells the story of a kid overcoming the obstacles. Rent it if you're an action fan, you won't be disappointed."
594,"it was quite comical!; I am sure thousands of children, teens and adults have seen Snow White, its a classic, who hasn't seen it?..Well i watched it again recently and thought it was very funny. Although it did not involve a lot of oral jokes it was more of physical. e.g. the turtle that takes forever to climb the stair, but when he finally reaches the top everyone goes back down again and he falls..very funny!..as you watch the cartoon i have noticed that its not what they say that is funny its what they do and how they do it. I found myself laughing out loud even though i knew it was a child's movie and did not want to seem like i was enjoying it..but I did...so to whoever did not yet see the classic feature, they are missing out..BIG TIME!!!"
42943,"You Have to Love American History to Appreciate this Movie,; This is one of my favorites. You would probably have to be a history nut to agree with me. While the story sometimes lags and gets boring, this is a well made period piece. The locations, wardrobe, dialect add to a historically accurate drama. Unlike The Patriot, this movie looks and feels real. Al Pacino's character Tom Dobb Is an ordinary man in extraordinary times. He is unwilling to fight as he has lost his entire family except for one young son who is lured in to the romance of war. In order to protect his son Tom Dobb must fight for his country. This is the viewpoint of the Revolutionary War from a common man. No generals or grand battle plans, just a man trying to save his family who helps save a country. There are so few movies dedicated to the Revolutionary War, This one is the best of them all."
8666,"Why was it so bad?; I have to agree with the minority of people; this movie DID NOT suck. Other than the plot was rather... weak and some dialog was corny, the special effects were very very good, Halle Berry was just HOT and the cinematography (as stated above) was less than excellent. Loved it. 4/5 to those who hated it and spat all over it, thats YOUR opinion. To us who liked it, congrats. I liked it very much, and on the 18th of January I will be holding my own copy of the movie, and I will be happy. Think about it, Halle Berry, Benjamin Bratt and Sharon Stone. All superb actresses/ actors. Put it together and you have Catwoman. A GREAT movie with lots of kick-a$$ fighting scenes, not to mention Halle Berry in that suit. Loved this movie( can't say it enough)"
6895,"Superb Cast / Touching Story; This movie is the kind of film that I would normally shy away from because it deals with family and sexuality. Those two subject, in the realm of television, are often treated either in a ""Hallmark Hall of fame"" way or it is totally dark and nihilistic. Writer/Director Jane Anderson has done a superb job in presenting the many layers of these complex people and their complex lives. Each family member is given their due in the sense that Ms. Anderson gives each of them enough time to show who they are. I think that it was pure genius to cast Jessica Lange as ""the wife"". From my point of view, her dynamic feminine presence made his choice to become a woman more compelling. Was he measuring his feminism against hers? how could he give up a woman like Ms. Lange? The last words spoken are the core of the film's message. It is worth the wait."
4016,"Boom, baby!; ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is a rare hilarious Disney movie. It's very different from any other Disney movie so this movie might also be very watchable to you Disney haters out there. The movie pace is incredibly high and the music by John Debney and Sting are a real surprise. The movie really is a non-stop hilarious comedy with some unique humor. Also the style, both visual and story-wise is different from any other previous Disney movie, which in this case is a positive thing. The characters are great. Kuzco and Pacha are a perfect team. Yzma is a remarkable villain and her sidekick Kronk is hilarious. Yep, Laughs are guaranteed in this very hip and hilarious movie! The story really is of no importance and most of it never makes sense but that's also why this movie is both unique and hilarious to watch over and over again. Highly recommendable to everyone! 9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
3134,"Great film!; This is one of the better foreign films I have seen lately. ""Grand Illusion"" is a movie that should be considered a timeless, cinematic classic. It goes into the human condition, assessing the theme of friendship as well as the theme of the realities of war. I'm surprised I can't find a classic like this at a video rental place such as Blockbuster. I really hate to say this but ""Grand Illusion"" is better than Luis Bunuel's ""L'Age ""D'Or."" I was fortunate to have seen ""Grand Illusion"" on a public access channel and was surprised to find out how popular it was in the foreign film world. I'd watch this again; it's a great film."
8365,"Breaking Taboos; 'The Mother' is that extraordinary piece of film making - it gets you thinking, it pulls no punches - and ultimately it leaves you thinking. Very much open-ended as to the lead character's fate. Anne Reid (which I only knew briefly from her appearances in some Victoria Wood-led projects and thought a fine comedienne) is truly superb here. Not the stereotypical widowed housewife that was perfect in marriage and motherhood at all. And not all that free-spirited and adventurous at first. She plays her character just with the right note that rings true (well, it did to me). Powerful cast. Great script. Renaissance of European cinema indeed ;)"
30810,"Good film, especially for Bill Murray; This film about an oceanographer named Steve Zissou is quite clever and funny in its own little way. Bill Murray is quite appropriate for the title role as an eccentric, odd oceanographer who is after an elusive jaguar shark for eating his buddy, Esteban, alive. His crew is quite strange. Everyone, including Zissou, wears what seems to be a pair of light blue pajamas and a red knit top. I'm not sure if that may be a homage to the late Jaques Cousteau or not. It could do with out the profanity and the mild violence. Still, it's a great laugh and quite Bill Murray-esquire. I would like to rent this on DVD eventually."
750,"Just didn't do it for me; I really wanted to like this movie. Sometimes Peter Sellers makes me laugh and sometimes I just think the way he plays the characters are too OTT. This movie is currently No.16 of all time and I just don't get it. Yes I know its a black comedy and your not necessarily supposed to be laughing out loud but for pity's sake a black comedy is still supposed to be funny. The first 30 minutes of the film passed without any comedy at all in my opinion. It then turned slightly more comical but an all time classic. Not for me. The only line that I can really recall was the 'no fighting, this is the war room'. That raised a smirk. Maybe this film worked well 41 years ago when it would have been controversial indeed but in these days there's just not enough there. The Dr. Strangelove character was worst of all. I felt like I was watching an episode of The Young Ones or something. Overall an okay way to spend a couple of hours, but oh so disappointing. I score it a 6"
33558,"Great film. Just a bit predictable; This is one of the best films Barry Pepper has done since Saving Private Ryan, although he was also very good in Green Mile. Lovely scenery all through film makes it a joy to watch. Could have done with a bit more detail about the 'Eskimo' people. Acting is good all the way through, even though there is not a lot said. Let down by the fact that she managed to speak really good English in the short time she knew him. He really couldn't have been as thick as he was making out, although for a pilot he made a very good hunter.I could be critical of a few things in the film, but I'm am so glad I took the time to sit and watch this one. It may be one you only watch once, but well worth a watch nonetheless."
31223,"Babe meets Seabiscuit by way of National Velvet and Rocky; I had a feeling before I went to see Racing Stripes that I knew how it would turn out before the credits rolled; that I even knew which Hollywood formula David Schmidt and Frederick Du Chau had elected to follow. I wasn't wrong. That said, Racing Stripes is as charming a movie in its way as Babe is. The animals can talk to each other when humans aren't around or aren't paying attention, and the dialog as much as the action is what moves the picture along. We have as our nonhuman heroes Stripes, a zebra accidentally abandoned by a circus who wants to race with all his heart; and Tucker, a Shetland pony who has participated in the training of many thoroughbreds as their stable companion. That is, as the humans see him; when they aren't around he's very like Mickey in the first three Rocky movies. On the people side, we have Nolan and Channing Walsh, the father-daughter team who own Stripes and Tucker. He's an ex-racehorse trainer who lost his heart when his amateur jockey wife was killed in a racetrack accident and she is the teenage girl who loves Stripes and wants to race him as her mother would have. A little cardboard cutout-ish for my taste, but not obtrusively so. There is also Woodzie, a 'track rat' who is the first outside the Walsh menagerie to believe in Stripes as a racer. Woodzie is somewhat disreputable (and I do wish there had been some explanation as how why he limps; is he a crippled ex-jockey or just carrying the damage of not paying off his bookie promptly?), but he knows what he's looking at and is instrumental in convincing Nolan to train Stripes. Of course, where you have heroes you have to have villains. On the animal side, there is Sir Trenton, a black thoroughbred stud who is bound and determined that A) Stripes will NOT be permitted to sully the racetrack with his presence; and B) That his son Trenton's Pride will continue the family tradition of winning the Kentucky Open. On the human side we have Clara Dalrymple, a wealthy bloodstock owner who is a combination of spoiled rich girl and Class A bitch, who in my opinion is in desperate need of a spanking. Without getting into the plot, I note that the supporting voices cast does an excellent job. Then again, when was the last time Dustin Hoffman, Whoopi Goldberg, Fred Dalton Thompson or Joe Pantoliano turned in bad performances? They are total professionals even when they don't appear on-camera. The one thing about the movie that grated, apart from the two horseflies Buzz and Scuzz who serve as mere comedy relief until the race actually starts, was the constant reference to other classic movies. I spotted references to Field of Dreams, Seabiscuit, Monty Python & the Holy Grail, Good Morning Vietnam, Babe, The Karate Kid, The Godfather and Scarface. And that doesn't count the homage to Rocky IV in the training-for-the-big-race sequence. There IS such a thing as overkill, folks. I know this film is aimed more at the kids than at adults, but Schmidt and Du Chau do a good enough job of entertaining and holding the adults' interest that most of their references qualify as gratuitous. The bottom line is that Racing Stripes is a movie parents can feel good about taking their kids to watch. The kids will be entertained and the parents won't end up with their brains dripping out of their ears like tapioca. This flick isn't going to win any Oscars, but it's a good example of its type. It's quite enjoyable regardless of your age."
6711,"A waste of time; Perhaps I am not sophisticated enough to see this movie as a work of art but I believe that this movie is not worth all the great reviews. The characters are very weak and superficial. Many times it is really boring and long. There were a few funny scenes but I liked Bill Murray much better in Groundhog Day! I also thought this movie was disrespectful of Japan and Japanese culture, which we could hardly see. A little more attention to Japan and its people would have avoided the silly stereo-typing. This movie really left me lost, not in translation, but in the movie theater. After watching this flick I asked me: Is that all there is?"
3739,"A Cinematic Soufflé; Beat together three witty stars until stiff, add a small gaggle of top character actors, gently fold in a few romantic locations, sprinkle liberally with sophisticated dialogue and steam bake for 83 minutes. Result - TROUBLE IN PARADISE. This scintillating & rarely seen comedy - director Ernst Lubitsch's masterpiece - is the epitome of frothy pre-Code sophistication. An utter delight from start (operatic-singing garbage gondolier) to finish (pocket picking in a taxi), the film should leave the viewer breathless in admiration. Lubitsch relied heavily on the intelligence of his audience. He knew that a delicate touch would be appreciated by those able to anticipate & understand the nuances of his humor. The fact that this worked so beautifully only two years after Hollywood fully embraced sound pictures shows the genius of the director's craft. This was to become his favorite film, and for very good reason. The plot, about a couple of adroit jewel thieves & the wealthy woman they attempt to fleece, is almost lighter-than-air, so effervescent is the quality of the writing. The performances add to this feeling of airy lightheadedness. Herbert Marshall is the very picture of moral ambiguity - the most larcenous situations cause not even the lift of an eyebrow; as a ladies' man, he positively oozes suavity from every pore. His partner in crime, Miriam Hopkins, is a comic study in barely controlled passion and the perfect match for Marshall; their intimate tit-for-tat body burgling is a refreshing take on a romantic prelude. Kay Francis, the center of the filmic storm, is pure stylish glamour; her sleek demeanor is entrancing as she deals with the other players, most of whom are interested in her millions. Rounding out the cast is a quartet of prime character actors: befuddled Edward Everett Horton & bemused Charlie Ruggles as Miss Francis' suitors; unctuous Robert Greig as her butler; and old Sir C. Aubrey Smith, marvelously fierce as the chairman of her corporate board of directors. Each is superb in his role. Movie mavens will recognize Leonid Kinskey as an angry Russian radical. Interestingly, when Paramount tried to reissue TROUBLE IN PARADISE in 1935, the rules of the newly enforced Production Code forbade it. The film's full cargo of innuendo kept it from entering any redistribution harbor for almost 30 years."
6586,"Better than the first two, but still lacks; I am still going to need therapy for a few years after that stiffler dog poo scene. Don't ask. ""American Wedding"" is actually in some ways a pretty funny movie. But it was still kind of old and lacking in gross out comedies. They're getting weak and predictable. Unfortunately, what most audiences find amusing is people getting hurt or doing something very stupid and harmful to others. I would recommend this to finish up the trilogy. Just so you can see how it ends. Other than that, it's nothing I found hilarious. The ""American Pie"" trilogy was very over rated. I don't get how this was a supposed great movie trilogy to my generation. That's pretty sad. 5/10"
8528,"Great comedy for all different senses of humor; I don't wanna take too much of your time here, so I'll make this quick. If you like slapstick, sarcasm, weird, crude, nonsense, or even dark humor: this movie has it all! I've never seen a movie that works on so many different comedy levels as this. The main characters are pretty much ""homages"" to other films. Namely Vince Vaughn and Steven Root's characters being an homage to Peter Venknan and Louis Tully from ""GHOSTBUSTERS"", and Ben Stiller is sorta reprising this same type character he played in ""HEAVYWEIGHTS"" and ""HAPPY GILMORE"". If you love Vince Vaughn playing his typecast wise-ass roles, this movie is for you. If you loved stiller acting obscene and weird, this movie is for you. If you love straight out slapstick watching the actors obviously in real pain, this is for you. I haven't seen a comedy in a long, long time that everyone I know likes as much as this film. I can only hope that this first time director is surrounded with as much talent the next time around because the script is great, but the actors really put some icing on the cake from the looks of it!"
30894,"What?; The idea was awesome, the actors were incredible, the story could of been very scary, but the writing was poor and there was no depth. I couldn't really get into this movie. I couldn't feel for the characters, there were a lot of cliffhangers, and the movie just ends very weirdly. Was it a happy ending? I don't know. Was it a sad ending? Again, I don't know. You leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. The movie had so much to give, but couldn't. Just because you can edit, doesn't mean you should, right? I wouldn't really recommend this movie because you just can't say that you left the movie feeling like it was completed. You'll just be confused. Trust me, you will probably thank me if you don't watch this movie. 3/10"
32291,"Woody does it again....again....again....again, etc.; Woody Allen should stop making movies - or the same movie again and again. His last good film of this type was Hannah and Her Sister (1986) - at least he (Woody) wasn't in this film - it's one redeeming quality. He always has the same background with similar characters and for the first time he didn't make one bad film - he made two. It's too bad he can't make a film with a new idea. He should make a film without ""Woody Allen"" as every character. I was very surprised to see that this film opened in Europe before the States. If he thinks he's ""Taking This Show on the Road"" - it's too late. Don't Waste Your Money!"
6755,"Surprisingly moving; I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie for ages. As a fan of the Evil Dead series and Ash in particular, the idea of Bruce Campbell playing a retired Elvis impersonator who may or may not be the genuine article, teaming up with an elderly black man who thinks he's JFK and fighting an ancient Egyptian mummy sounds like laugh a minute, non-stop anarchy. So imagine my surprise when the film I saw was considerably more gentle than that. Sure, it's very funny in places and the duo's battle with the mummy was hilarious, nonsensical fun, but there is a genuine sense of humanity mixed in with it all. As Elvis, Campbell is a charismatic, gruff old man who spends his time looking back on the events of his life and Ossie Davis is equally charming as the crazy old fellow who thinks he may be JFK. Together, the two make a perfect on screen pair, attempting to defend their fellow rest home residents from a nightmarish apparition by night and struggling to retain their dignity in front of the staff and visitors by day. Don't be fooled by the fact that Campbell appears and battles an undead monster, this has otherwise little in common with the Evil Dead series. While those were great movies, this is far more poignant. It is equally deranged, but is at times funny, touching, uplifting and come the ending, sad too. Fantastic movie."
4238,"Not spectacular, but pretty much what one comes to expect from Lee Tamahori; After seeing The Edge and Mulholland Falls, I can't say I'm really surprised by the quality of this film. Still, I have to say that I did find this movie to be quite entertaining and thought it did what it was supposed to do, for a mystery-thriller. It takes off almost immediately, and succeeds in being thoroughly interesting. The plot is pretty good, and experiencing it unravel is pretty intriguing, possibly even more-so than that of other later and contemporary thrillers. The pacing is solid. The acting is good; Freeman is stellar as always, and Potter gives a convincing performance. Wincott surprised me with the high quality of his acting, but maybe that's because I've only seen him in Alien: Resurrection, and that movie can make even the most impressive actor seem talentless. Boorem was pretty good for a child-actor, but I have seen better(even at younger ages), so it's no massive accomplishment. The characters are fairly well-written and interesting, but I'm not sure they're entirely credible. The dialog is fairly well-written and equally well-delivered. The special effects are pretty standard stuff, except for a short car-sequence in the beginning which looked entirely convincing. I'm almost certain I know how they did it, but at the moment I saw it, I didn't think about it at all. They pulled that off quite nicely, I think. The film is, like many other recent thrillers, kept going through a number of plot twists, one more unlikely than the other. This is unfortunate, but it seems like that's the way thrillers are going these days. I will say that the twists could have been much, much worse. Overall, a standard mystery-thriller with a good cast and good for at least one attentive viewing. I recommend this to fans of one or more of the actors, the director(if he actually has fans, that is) and/or of the mystery and thriller genres. 7/10"
5065,"so scary; I saw this movie on television last night and watched it alone in the dark which is not such a smart thing to do for a guy like me because I'm very easily scared person. But I must say I enjoyed this movie never the less. It had a storyline who kept me interested the whole time but it also scared the h**l out of me. It has few scenes which made my heartbeat go up like the scene where John Klein (Gere) lies in bed, rolls over and suddenly his wive (Messing) appeared out of nowhere. The subject of this movie is also very interesting, after this movie I went online and did a little research on the matter. What I read there was very interesting and made me think a lot about the subject. I saw in the message board that people were complaining about that this movie doesn't follow the real events to the details but I must remind those people that this movie is only BASED on real events, this is a Hollywood movie, not a documentary. But I really liked this movie though I was to scared to go to bed the next two hours after it was finished. The scary part of this movie was not what it showed you, there was no gore and that kind of stuff but it made your imagination go frenzy, it was not so much what you saw but what you imagined what it would be like. This is not the greatest movie ever or anything like that but fine movie never the less."
6032,One of my all time favorite movies.; I watched this movie when I was younger and this has been one of my favorite movies of all time. The ending still touches me so. A very beautiful story with breath-taking views of France and Italy. I hope to re-enact the gondola scenes with the woman that I love one day. It is nice to see how Diane Lane has grown in her career. An Sir Laurence Oliver is a master of his craft. This is a great movie for all ages and families to view together with out worry of the movies we see today. I never get tired of watching this movie and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a nice little romantic movie for the whole family to watch.
7375,"Just OK and predictable; Rented DVD and watched this film last night. I thought the movie was OK for a romantic comedy even though it was very predictable. Prince Edvard of Denmark is tired of paparazzi following him everywhere and decides escape somewhere. Lucky for him he sees a TV commercial for ""Girls gone wild"" in Wisconsin. There he enrolls in local University and meets Paige (played by Julia Stiles). I don't know if it is just me but every time I see Julia Stiles she plays the exact same character - too smart and too proper. You kind of know what to expect from her. At first, they seem to hate each other but soon enough Eddie (as he is known in Wisconsin) and Paige hit it off. As their relationship grows, paparazzi expose the truth. Thinking she has been deceived Paige breaks up with Eddie. In the meantime, Eddie's father becomes ill and he has to pass the throne to his son. Prince Edvard leaves for Denmark. Realizing that she made a mistake, Paige drops everything and jumps on a plane to Denmark. Edvard proposes to Paige and they get ready for his coronation. But the longer she stays in the castle, Paige realizes she cannot handle being a queen. Hence, she leaves him and goes back to Wisconsin to finish college. But at the and during the graduation ceremony Edvard shows up, they hug and kiss, and he tells her he'd wait for her forever. That is essentially the plot. There are few other subplots that never get fully developed (eg. his help and protector Soren). There is also an alternate ending to the movie, which in fact, I prefer. In the alternate ending (available on DVD) Edvard never comes back for Paige. Instead, we see several pictures of Paige as she advanced through college and graduation. The reason I liked this ending is because it was more realistic. Now I will list the problems that I had with the film. First of all, I didn't think there was much chemistry between the main characters, they fight and then suddenly they are in love in a matter of few weeks? Seems to me that the story was underdeveloped. I also don't believe that Eddie could just fall in love with one woman especially after what we see in the beginning. Initially, he is shown as irresponsible gigolo. There are also several plot holes: how could Eddie enroll in college, wouldn't his identity reveal who he is? They also tried to make it a comedy which to be honest didn't work for me. His helper Soren was too stiff and out of place. And finally, did anyone notice how the plot of this movie is similar to ""Coming to America"" with Eddie Murphy? Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall did such an outstanding job in the film that I would take ""Coming to America"" over ""The prince and me"" anytime."
30894,"""White Noise"" Is Actually More Of  A Flushing Sound; It seems that every actor takes regrettable roles, ones that are usually considered part of ""paying their dues"" and which are later forgiven or forgotten by their fans. John Wayne isn't remembered for his portrayal of Genghis Kahn, nor is Sly Stallone for his turn as Oscar. There is hope, then, that audiences seeing ""White Noise"" will have an equally short memory about Michael Keaton. How such a versatile and gifted actor got snared by this disjointed, convoluted, and amateurish attempt at a supernatural thriller is simply incomprehensible. The only 'name' in an otherwise unrecognizable cast, Keaton wanders through ""White Noise"" on auto-pilot, as though his instincts  recognizing the absence of a story  simply shut down his talent. Keaton is cast in the role of Jonathan Rivers, a rising architect married to an acclaimed author. Amicably divorced from a prior wife, doting dad to a son from the first marriage and soon-to-be dad in his second, Rivers is at the top of The Good Life. Alas, he is an irresistible target for the Fates, who throw his life into utter turmoil. People close to Rivers begin dying, one at first, then more, in a growing epidemic of death. These interconnected deaths are brought on by Rivers increasing obsession with EVP  'electronic voice phenomenon,' the supposed appearance of ghostly voices and images on video tapes and other media. Unfortunately, these fatal connections are never explored beyond their relation to EVP and the fact that such 'electronic meddling' disturbs 'them.' But who are 'they?' Why are they disturbed? We're not told. Neither do we learn how the dead are able to see the future. Or why the police never seem terribly suspicious of Rivers, despite his presence at the scene of so many gruesome deaths and accidents. In fact, the one thing of which we are certain at the end of the film is the sorrow Rivers expresses to his son. Viewers who wade into this morass are likely to be sorry, too. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Keaton's career, which somehow survived ""Johnny Dangerously,"" will escape the assault of ""White Noise"" as well. Leland Edward Stone"
27721,"Lush art movie; Ultimately, this movie is about a woman trying to locate a man who was (thought) lost in a (the) great war. I see this as symbolizing the human condition, which is a kind of war, the objects and weapons of which being our folly, ignorance and petty conflicts, and the woman and the man represent our highest ideals, beauty and truth, trying tirelessly and against all odds to regain the connection that was once lost. This much is, it seems to me, the archetypal story and meaning of almost all significant tales of fiction and poetry; a narrative structure that recurs in all art, also seen recently in Tim Burton's fantastic Big Fish, which was however much more intellectually complex. A Very Long Engagement is very French, very European, very Jeunet and very aesthetic. These are not bad elements, but nor are they unequivocally good, either. The film is also harsh and intense and very emotional, but much of this emotion is a very simplistic emotion that has hope and faith but also fear and insecurity, and ultimately ends up resolving very little, if anything at all. Cinematographically, the movie is absolutely beautiful. Every picture truly is a painting. But there is also a strong (and, I hesitate to say, effeminate) naivety which makes it reach for higher artistic grounds than it has the capacity to grasp. Overall, I thought it was slightly dull. It was beautiful, but didn't really achieve much of anything. It was the work of a director more in love with film-making per se than in the message he could have conveyed through it. 7 out of 10."
8972,"Oceans12 meets 'modern' Indiana Jones.. - no Indiana though.; .. Well, no Jones either. This movie has it all: Good guy, bad guy, intrigue, drama and love. Still it lacks the ability to mix it all up and make a tasty cocktail. It's more like a glass of warm beer. Anyway the plot is rather plain and straightforward, no surprises. It's one of those movies that makes you wonder, where did they get all those _flaming_ torches? - and whats up with all the lucky(and evidently accurate) guesses..? It has the ability to be OK(yep, merely OK), but fails miserably. When I tell people about it, they think it sounds a little cool, when in fact it actually kinda stinks. Go watch 'The Shawshank Redemption' instead - now thats a movie."
8981,"Tweens Need Not Apply.; Truly a film for all seasons, Closer is one of those rare films that will satisfy no matter what your particular caveat. What follows are merely a few examples of it's all-encompassing appeal. 1. Are You Trying To End A Relationship Without Feeling Guilty? If so, simply lure the unsuspecting party to see this film. from the cast they will automatically assume it to be a Runaway Bride/Alfie hybrid movie. Just wait until the internet chatroom scene, or the moment where Julia Roberts describes her sexual proclivities in the dirtiest language imaginable. ( This works best with sixteen year old girls with a Lizzy McGuire fixation ) 2. Are You A Big Stinking Pervert ? Then why not spend almost an hour sweating with anticipation at the prospect of seeing Natalie Portman giving the most sensual performance since Scarlett Johansenn in 'Lost in Translation' and then another hour trying to subdue your semi-tumescent member, an inevitable byproduct of the stripping scene. ( This Works best with fifteen year old nerds with Princess Amidala fixations ) 3. Are you a fan of incisive, honed and crafted writing, bought to life by a cast on the absolute top of their game, ( career bests for everyone involved ) and fashioned by a veteran director whose work still brims with wit, imagination and any other superlatives you care to lavish on him? In short. A movie made by grown ups, for grown-ups."
8977,"If you like historical epics, you'll like it, if not, then avoid; I enjoyed this film. Most of it seemed reasonably accurate and the battle scenes are very good. Hopkin's narration is a useful and necessary. You may be confused why all the Macedonians have Irish accents, and the other Greeks have 'English' accents - it is to portray the fact that although the Macedonians spoke Greek, they weren't total Greek in terms of ethnicity and history. This device can be confusing at first, but it does make some sense. If you like historical epics (e.g. Spartacus, War and Peace etc) you like this. If you are interested in Alexander the great, you'll also probably like this. If your favourite movie is 2Fast2Furious, its probably not your cup of tea. If you can't accept the fact that Alexander was bisexual, then a: get a life, its fact, b: go watch top gun instead :-)"
1392,"Underrated Gem; In the wake of the huge success ""Sideways"" is garnering lately, everyone should look back at this incredible film from Alexander Payne, which shows off everything he and writing partner Jim Taylor are best at- the dark skewering of small-town America, rich with satire and heart. I had seen all of Payne's films except this one, and although I really loved all of them, this may be his most fully realized. This is probably because his targets are hit exactly dead-on, and the absurdity of the situations are in fact, achingly real. Laura Dern gives a wonderful and unflinching portrayal of Ruth, and the rest of the cast, especially Swoosie Kurtz, Mary Kay Place, and in a small role, Burt Reynolds, are exceptional as the targets of Payne's satire. Payne fills his films with little details of small-town life, and here they add so much to the point of the story. Take for example the grace that Kurtwood Smith's character gives, which is barely heard because of the roaring plane overhead. It is these details that are the crux of a story like this. So as ""Sideways"" continues to claim many awards (and rightfully so), I urge you to check out this earlier film from Payne, and experience a brilliant little film, and one of the gutsiest movies you may ever see."
8640,"Just don't get it.; I don't get why people bash this movie so much. I honestly cant see many things that are wrong with it. The acting by Mads Mikkelsen (Tristan) was excellent, And of course Keira Knightley's beauty alone is enough to see the movie. I didn't find it to be too boring or long. And i thought that the action scenes were spaced apart pretty good. I mean can you compare it to Gladiator, or Braveheart? no. I can understand how certain people are complaining about the film not being true to the time its supposed to take place in, how Sarmatians never fought for the roman empire, and other aspects of the movie. But people like that have to realize that this is a movie, it's purpose is to entertain, not to educate.However, this is just my opinion."
5810,"eminem album that i haven't heard of?; OK, I just found this Eminem album recently, but I'm not sure if it's legitimate or not, because I've never heard ANYTHING about it until now. Off The Wall...? Anybody else heard of it/know if it's legit or not? I'd just like to know....thanks. Also, when did this album come out? I follow him pretty close, and I have most of his stuff including Straight from the Lab EP, Infinite, and The Slim Shady EP, mostly underground stuff, so I don't know how I missed this one, maybe a foreign release? Oh well, PLEASE respond, I need to know if this album is real or not. Alright, I guess I need ten lines, so I'll ask another question. Does anybody know any good computer programs for making rap beats? I'm kind of interested in being creative in this way. Thanks. B"
140042,"Mr. Emotionaly deprived; Forty-something Mattia (Adriano Celentano) has every woman in town lusting after him. This starts during the opening credits and last the whole movie long, (except when he puts on a disguise, of course). Every time a woman wants to get hitched, he drags out his 'daughter' (actually the girl next door) to pass judgment on them. Needles to say, none of the ladies meet her requirements. But now this advertising student, Michela, is about to turn 18 and her feelings for 'daddy' are drifting dangerously into taboo territory. Mattia does not notice, but then this guy emotes less than a Golem made of stone. I think he only smiled once in the entire picture, and that was when he was pretending to be someone else. Mattia is actually confessing everything to a priest. As he obviously enjoys bragging about his conquests to this poor clergyman, they go jogging and cycling while he rambles on. This framework is simply an excuse to put in a couple of cookie Tex Avery gags in some of the romantic episodes (since we are seeing it the way Mattia recalls it) . The most amusing of these is his affair with Rosala the clothes store owner and her jealous Pygmy husband. Less well rounded are his flings with Gloria the American reporter and an ebony lady. The latter features the most politically incorrect imitation of a coloured man since Gene Wilder in Silver Streak. Michela remains the only interesting female in the picture, but only just. Daddy dearest helps her to cheat during a geography exam with the use of a typewriter and a role of toilet paper. Notice that none of her classmates fall for him (probably still under age). That Adriano Celentano sure likes to show off his chest. Nearly every outfit he wears is cut like Montalban in The wrath of Kahn. I don't recall anybody actually walking around like that in the early eighties. Anyway, our worst fears have come true: barely legal Michela really wants to sleep with the man everybody thinks is her father. Sure she has a nerdy love interest of her own called Claudio, but she prefers some of those Celntano pecks. They go for a pointless trip to Milano to have a serious father-daughter discussion (via walkie talky). Michela then decides it's time for some wrath and gives Mattia's latest lover her blessing. So now he has to tie the knot with this blonde with a cleaning fixation and we can finally say goodbye to all of these flashbacks. Time for a 'shocking' grand finale that left me as cold as Celentano. 4 out of 10"
6768,"Luther for whom?; Here we have another bio-film a la Hollywood, in which a major character in History is abused to please some social sector willingly to spend their money, if and only if, the character fits the frame of traditional pattern in which he/she survives. Martin Luther has been downgraded to a well-known simplistic dialogue served under factual circumstances, so the film might be visualized and accountable as a historical reproduction through art. Once the spectator identifies the venue of (his/her) knowledge in the images, as soon as the dialogue between images and spectator stabilizes, any one may buy any 'secondary' nuances in the replica, such as an impossible Luther as portrayed by an unfitting Fiennes, or a Von Bora, playing courtier, by an actress whose name sounds irrelevant now. Certainly, period and costumes are closely observed, masses and individuals are well balanced even though the film fails to deliver the strength of revolution and reformation to the plot. Another masquerade, unworthy of a man like Martin Luther."
30822,"Decent film a little over produced; Bottom line, good. Not great, or ""best picture of the year"" but a good film with some excellent acting by all involved, especially Topher Grace. My one criticism might be the overbearing music and musical video interludes""Here is the music to show that he is sad"" ""Here is the music to show that he is Lost"". Didn't work. Don't get me wrong, Barry Levinson in ""Homicide Life on the Street"", I thought always did a good job at using music to convey emotion when words do not suffice. But Paul Weitz is no Barry Levinson. Perhaps a few more jobs under his belt and it wont be so awkward. But then again, it could have been some studio stooge sent to ""retail it up"" and not really his fault. Quaid I thought did a good job at conveying his character's awkwardness with having a boss half his age and none of his experience (There are some great lines scattered throughout that I wont spoil here). Add in that he is at that age where he is too young to retire and too old to start again you get a setting that is all too familiarly frightening to many of us. In a business world where buzz words, gimmicks and youth obsession are too often substituted for experience and wisdom, Weitz successfully created an appropriate emblematic figure in Carter Duryea. Almost ""Soviet"" in his unquestioned beliefs, he goes through a mostly believable transformation that ends appropriately, and not as Hollywood sap. For Hollywood, this is a very good film. For the world of film in general, just good."
7361,"A true Masterpiece that leaves a lasting impression; Entering the movie theater, I expected the Eternal sunshine..., to be one of the many mediocre movies dealing with love, where the most intriguing thing would be when and how the couple will kiss, make up and then the lights will go on and the female part of the theater will leave happy while the males, a little bored and already thinking of going home and watching the sport news, will be trying to suppress their moans....but NO this movie was something different, something out of the ordinary and truly inspiring. It would recommend it to anyone who is willing to explore his own feelings, reach out to the bottom of his soul and maybe, just maybe at the end this will help you understand why men and women need each other no matter what"
1219,"Among the Most Influential Films of All Time; This film has to rank as probably one of the most influential films ever made. It's one of those films that is referenced constantly. By the way, this is a film where the less you know about it beforehand, the more powerful it is. In fact in the original advertising, Hitchcock asked viewers not to reveal the film's shocks to their friends afterwards, and also that viewers had to be seated from the beginning of the film (when ""Psycho"" was released people were in the habit of walking into movies at any point). As a result, i will try my best not to give too much away. Based on a fairly good thriller by Robert Bloch, inspired by the life and crimes of real-life serial killer Ed Gein, this movie constantly unsettles the viewer. Hitchcock knew about suspense and he knew how to manipulate an audience which he does here brilliantly. Almost everything in this film is pitch perfect and the shocks are still striking. The actors, especially the brilliant Anthony Perkins, are all superb. Special note has to be taken of the famous score by Bernard Herrmann. Whether or not you're a horror movie fan, this is a must-see."
69224,"A love story which highlights the class struggle in the 90s and the nostalgia of yesteryear; Marius ET Jeannette is a nostalgic film created to highlight class struggle and things long gone. The latter is evident by the close nit community given by the living arrangements and how the people interact. The class struggle, given by the poor precarious employment and by the simplicity of life, where sex seems to be the only interest they can afford, highlights a longing for the France that once was the biggest power in the European union ( notice how in the beginning of the movie, a world balloon floats in the once great harbour - a symbol of globalisation and capitalism that has left France behind). Overall the movie is the same as many other french romantic movies .. a very slow start to a seemingly pointless love story , where all you can think is ""get over it you two and get together!"" and where the ending is rather disappointing. I wouldn't recommend it unless you had to study the french bitterness of the 90s."
608,"very good...YAW!!!; Don't get me wrong, Fargo was an excellent movie. Frances McDormand was perfect and deserved her Oscar, the plot was well put together, and the pace flowed well. However, I have to say that this film is just a little bit overrated. It is an excellent comedy, but when I first saw it, I was expecting a little more. It was hilarious (those accents), however the ending was weak and I don't think it was an Oscar caliber movie. I also can't see why it is on the top 100 films of all time list according to AFI. It was like 90 or something. Comedy wise, it's right up there, but poignant films such as American Beauty, Almost Famous and Traffic are much more deserving of being on a 100 Greatest list. I can see how it is popular, but it isn't ""that"" good. Overall though, it was very enjoyable to watch and it is a cult classic. 9/10..."
30812,"Now do you see how good Leo is??; Titanic was such a disaster for Leonardo DiCaprio's credibility, but I think he's finally won it back with this one. I think this an exceptional performance from Leonardo and I agree with comparisons to DeNiro in Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. Go on all you Leo critics: watch The Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, etc etc. the boy can act!! I was critical of his performances in The Beach and Gangs Of New York (which I don't really like as a film), but this performance in the Aviator has won over a lot of Leo-haters, so intense, you can just see how hard he's working! My only criticism of The Aviator is it's too long. I don't know why everyone is making 3hr films nowadays, but I think Scorsese could have cut 30 to 60 minutes off this one, and still told us the story, it drags on and on. other than that it's excellent, it tells the story of genius Howard Hughs who I knew nothing about before. Well done Mr DiCaprio - keep it up! I'm a bit worried about Baz Luhrmann's Alexander, but it could be excellent."
7090,"Somewhat hyped..; We would give this movie a 6.5, no more than that. Maybe less. What did we enjoy? The story, which is beautiful, and *spoilers* roughly, is told in a few different ways. What didn't we like? A lot of the meaning (for the viewer) here seems to be in developing ideas from similar films such as crouching tiger. While this works for the film fans, we suspect that for people who see ""Hero"" as a stand-alone project, such meanings will be lost. And in that case, what are we left with? 1. The fighting scenes in this film were exaggerated. 2. The character of the young-woman warrior (Moon) didn't really play any role. Seemed that her presence in the movie was meant to capture some viewers who remembered her from crouching tiger / hidden dragon. As some commented, the sex scene with her did not contribute anything to the film. Neither do her fight scenes. In particular, the one where she fights Flying Snow amongst the falling leaves was ridiculous. This scene seemed bent on infusing emotion into the viewer in a very explicit way  reminded me of Fleetwood Mac's music  just tries too hard to infuse you with emotion. 3. In general, it seemed that all the good motives in crouching tiger were taken to an extreme here  the flying scenes, walking on water scenes etc' simply don't play any important role here. As far as Jet-Li films go, our favorites are clearly his earlier, non-westernized works  Fist of Legend, Last Hero in China, The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk (Truly amazing film!),"
74857,"Strategic Air Command; As a retired Air Force member and having been in SAC several times allows me to appreciate the attention to detail of this movie in spite of the ""Hollywooding"" of some aspects. In particular the character of General Hawkes is remarkably similar to certain ""real world"" leaders of SAC (LeMay?). All in all its an outstanding look at the Air Force of the early fifties with an additional bonus of viewing the ""real"" buildings and equipment of the era (sadly lacking in newer offerings) and seeing some now-museum-piece aircraft on the ground and in flight. Of particular note to aircraft buffs is the shot of a B-45 in the back ground during the landing of the ""civilian"" DC-3. Detractors of this movie have obviously never served and don't understand..... Outstanding period piece."
2376,"One Of The Best James Bond Movies Of All Time; A View To A Kill (1985) is one of the most action-packed 007 movies ever made. It also features excellent dialogue, a great villain portrayed by Christopher Walken, awe-inspiring car chases and an explosive ending! The opening sequence or ""teaser"" for this Bond film is one of the best ever filmed. The teaser features James Bond skiing down a mountain trying to escape from the bad guys. Oh, and during one part of the teaser, a great song by The Beach Boys is played. The Bond song for this film is exceptional in all aspects of the word. The song is wonderfully song by Duran Duran. As for James Bond himself, he is superbly played by Roger Moore. Some people think that he was too old to play 007 in this film, but I do not agree with them. Sure he was older than the previous Bonds but he wasn't as old as some people said he was. Q has a short but memorable part in this Bond film. In this movie, Q is just as funny as he is in other Bond films... and then some! If you are a James Bond fan you should watch this incredible film, and even if you are not a Bond fan, you'll really like the action sequences!"
1635,"A Gem of Film; This is one of my favourite films ever. I absolutely love the feel of it, wonderful 60s/70s feel, wonderful performances from Sigourney Weaver, Elijah Wodd, Kevin Kline, Christina Ricci and Tobey Maguire (And Katie!). Loads of my favourite actors. i love the honesty of it, it seems real to me, the awkwardness of the teenagers and their budding sexuality, I really believed this film. I don't agree that Tobey Maguire is too blank faced or that Katie Holmes would never have had him in her house, s'not true. Tobey is a great awkward teenager, and I can imagine exactly that situation occurring, in fact something like that has happened to me in the past on more than one occasion (with myself as the less attractive teenager!). I love the reality of the rejection of the better looking kid (as happens to Elijah Wood). I am such a fan of Elijah Wood, I really hope playing Frodo the Hobbit has not typecast him too much as a comedy fantasy character in everyone's minds, he's also great in The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Not that I dislike his performance as Frodo - I think it's great - I just know that will put loads of people off him. Do watch this film!!"
27220,"One of the worst movies of all time; This has got to be one of the worst movies ever. It certainly is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrendous, especially when compared to the original. The jokes, which worked perfectly in Cruel Intentions, fall flat and are the same, word for word, as the original ones. The actors in the movie are not particularly attractive people, and the plot is horrible. I loved the first movie, the acting was great and the jokes were funny. This, however, is simply a bad, bad rehashing. Don't bother to watch this, watch the original instead. I will never get back the hour plus of my life that I wasted watching this."
30894,"Extremely Poor Film; I've just seen this film and can't believe how such a poor , cliché-ridden film has been given such a promo push in the UK. The premise ( as presented) is laughable and the script works better as a spoof than a thriller. It has more stereotypes than a 'carry on' film ( can't give detail as will spoil film - if possible ). Michael Keaton is a favourite of mine but i'm sure his obvious intelligence would have caused him problems with this material. About 20 people ( out of 200 ) walked out of the audience I was in and people were chatting. Clichéd, formulaic thrillers can still provide a couple of hours of innocent fun. Not this one."
3070,"A film that makes Manos look good; I kept hearing from people that this film was really smart and funny and cool and so on, so I gave it a whirl. My mistake. There's nothing resembling a plot or a joke, the acting is appalling and the half hour I watched before saying words I wouldn't say in front of my mother and switching off contained no redeeming features whatsoever. Why is this film worse than Manos? Because Manos had no budget and no professionals involved, is why. Buckaroo Banzai is on par with Manos in virtually every department, except that its cast contains normally excellent actors like Peter Weller, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Lloyd. If you die and go to hell, this film will be showing at the cinema. Avoid at all costs."
30707,"Pure, unbridled excellence; I'll cut to the chase -- this movie is flawless. The direction, cinematography, and writing are all significantly better than ""Mystic River,"" with all three leads (Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman) turning in Oscar-worthy performances. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is an intimate triumph, and could legitimately be called an ""instant classic."" The specifics of the story are available everywhere, so I'll spare those details. Less often discussed is the skill with which Eastwood treads the razor-thin border between ""been there, done that"" and perfection. A look at this film's basic premise might make it appear rife with potential cliché, and the finished product may have lived down to that expectation in the hands of a less insightful director. Watching Eastwood evade the unintentional humor of Hollywood's traditional ""underdog-made-good"" stories (and soaking up the leads' brilliant performances) comprises much of the appeal of the film's first two acts. The third act is simply arresting. The acting is one hundred percent flawless throughout the film's last thirty minutes. The pacing remains perfect. To a man, the sold-out audience of which I was a member was utterly, silently transfixed after the beginning of the film's third stanza. As soon as you possibly can, see this movie. There is good reason for the unilaterally glowing reviews it has received from the ""big"" critics: ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a masterpiece."
8969,"A bit disappointing; As a big fan of the BJ books, I was prepared to some disappointment when I went to see this movie. After all, the first movie was less funny than the book too. Still, that movie was very well done and enjoyable. This one, well, less so. First of all, Renee got too much weight. This might seem a silly detail but if we want to believe that the movie starts just 6 weeks from where the 1st one ended, well, the protagonist looks too different for us not to notice... Apart from this, the actors are as good as in the first one - of course. But the plot is weaker, and not well organized. What made sense in the book doesn't in the film (e.g. the Rebecca sub-plot - what was that about??). Some of the funnier bits of the book are left out, which is a shame (the interview to Colin Firth in Rome obviously couldn't be there, but they could have done it with a different famous actor; the weekend at Rebecca's country house should have been there too). But most of all, some of the 1st movie is copied almost word by word! Even the camera angles are the same (e.g. the jumper scene at the beginning, or the knickers scene with Daniell Cleaver, or the fight scene). A bit too much. My favourite was Firth in the 1st film, but Hugh Grant is definitely the best part of the movie here - that role just fits him perfectly. The fight scene, even if copied from the first one, is really funny. Some other gags, like the skiing one, are hilarious too. So yes, there are some good parts, and maybe it might be worth watching it again to find some more. But I think they missed chance to make a fantastic sequel. Sharon Maguire did an excellent job with the first movie, and I definitely think she should have stayed. She is the real Shazzer after all... All in all, I'm going back to the books, and if Helen Fielding does write a 3rd one, I hope they'll do some more thinking before making a film from it!"
8983,"Watch it ON BIG SCREEN!!!; I watched it on DVD. But it didn't strike me as I have just watched second time on the big screen !! The surrounded 3D Sound, and detail in clothing, a much clearer actor's face expression so you can see their body subtext(not just the dialog), and nice scenery. I was totally blown away that a big screen can make such a big different on a movie!!! I can said my 8 dollars are completely worth spending. It was twisted, eye massaging, and ear stimulating!!!. It is almost a perfect movie for me now I can't complain more. Go WATCH IT IN BIG SCREEN WHILE YOU STILL CAN. It is playing everywhere in theaters now. The sub-tittle is just at the perfect speed unless you have never read a book in your life before!!!"
4878,"can anyone tell me the name of the book its based on?; whats the name of the book its based on? anyone know? really liked the movie but well confused, can anyone tell me the name of the novel its based on so i can read it and satisfy my burning questions about this great movie I'm confused about the role of frank the bunny, and whether Donnie actually had the ability to time travel... i watched the directors cut and didn't find it any better than the original but i do really like the soundtrack... its a shame such a talented actor (Donnie) went on to make day after tomorrow which in my opinion was a poor film... but thats a topic for another debate I'm just trying to fill 10 lines!! just want book title and/or explanations from anyone please... much thanks stef."
27266,"Quite Good - but I was bored, sorry!; I am going to sound like a philistine on this one but I did get really bored. I did like some parts of it, I liked the storyline of the Landlords's daughter and her frustrated love affair with the Japanese guy and her writing abilities. I really enjoyed that and also the fictionalised futuristic version of it - I found that interesting. Also the relationship with the professional gambler was interesting, but I did not like the relationship with Ziyi Zhang, it was interesting to see her in a non sword fighting role! But I didn't like this relationship, I found it predictable and bland and frustrating - maybe that's the point, but I got bored, and it didn't feel like it was the best possible performance from Ziyi Zhang. I do love her in Crouching Tiger (predictably) but I'm not sure why she has to be in every high profile Cantonese language film, in the same way that Gael Garcia Bernal appears to be in all famous Mexican films!! I'm sure I'm being uncool and intellectually base about this, but I was bored. Some bits showed a lot of promise though."
6539,"It was a great pirate tale.; I thought that Pirates of the Caribbean was a great movie. i thought Johnny Depp was great as the sexy captain Jack Sparrow. I cant wait till the 2nd part of this story comes out to see more of Johnny and Orlando. The computer graphics were great, they really made the damned crew come to life. Johnny Depp was the best man to cast as Captain Jack Sparrow, he really grabs the character and brings him to life. The action sequences in the movie were extravagant, how Orlando and Johnny danced around sword fighting and the visual effects of battle between two 18th century battle ships. This is definitely the kind of movie that brings the whole family together and has viewers asking for more."
1488,"Better if you do not expect an action (and especially not a thriller) film; As a child in Ireland, Frankie McGuire (Brad Pitt) sees his dad gunned down for his involvement with the Irish Republican Army (IRA). As an adult, McGuire has followed in his dad's footsteps. When the IRA decides it needs more firepower, they hatch a plan that involves McGuire going to the United States to pick up a shipment of Stinger missiles. Through American IRA contacts, McGuire adopts a false identity and housing is arranged with a non-involved Irish family headed by New York City cop Tom O'Meara (Harrison Ford). There is an impression that The Devil's Own is an action film. The Internet Movie Database has it listed as ""Action/Drama/Thriller"". Although there are some action elements in the film, this is really a tragic drama, almost in a classical sense, and it's best to approach the film with only that genre in mind. The plot is fairly complex and the film tends to move slowly--much more slowly than a typical actioner or thriller. The heart of the story is McGuire's relationship with O'Meara and his family. All of the other material--the IRA stuff, the mob and terrorist stuff, the New York City cop stuff, and so on, are not the focus. Those elements are present to help establish characterization, to build the relationship and understanding between McGuire and O'Meara, and to provide a justification for the developments in the film, and particularly the conclusion, which all have poignant things to say about the decisions that we make and why we make them. The film largely succeeds if seen from this dramatic perspective. It's not quite a 10, however, as it always seems slightly distanced from the viewer. It's an 8 out of 10 for me. (This comment was originally posted on January 16, 2005 and ended with the above. The following was added much later after reading through some other user comments:) We should not forget that even though it takes elements from the real world to construct its story, The Devil's Own is NOT intended to be journalistic or a documentary. There is no claim that it is giving an accurate portrayal of political situations, and it's not intended to campaign for one side or another in a real-world political situation. This is fiction, folks, and should be judged _as fiction_. For that, you should forget about what you know of the real world, and assess the story, images and sounds you experience from your television. Does the story work as a self-contained entity? Are the performances good? Is it visually attractive/rewarding? Those are the kinds of things we should be judging. For me, The Devil's Own succeeded as a drama about relationships, with its poignancy arrived at primarily by making two people from very different worlds, with very different outlooks, learn to see things from different perspectives. That's great if you're very knowledgeable about Northern Ireland in the real world and if you have strong opinions about terrorism. However, your knowledge and opinions on that stuff have nothing to do with this film."

8977,"how Alexander conquered the known world while facing different phases in his life; Finally I saw this movie! After all that talking and controversy about it, I became more and more curious about what this talking all about. I must say that I've seen better epic movies ... even Troy was better! However I give this movie a 7 out of 10 ... It's not that bad but it could have been done much better. Firstly: I cannot understand why there was all that talking about Alexander's sexuality and the 'gay scenes' that there were supposed to be. There wasn't a big deal really! It's true that there is a lot of flirting between guys but only one kiss was seen in the movie that of Alexander (Farrell) kissing a young male dancer. The sex scene with Alexander's wife was by far more explicit when compared. I think and agree that the movie is historically accurate and that Alexander was bisexual. Sexuality was not an issue at those days so men were more free to do whatever they wanted to. Homosexuality was not a taboo!!! I admire Farrell for taking such roles ... it wasn't the first time that we saw him as a bisexual (A home a the end of the world). He is known to be some kind of a playboy so pretending to be the opposite in movies might be hard and it shows good acting. Acting means showing feelings that you don't really feel, and I think that Farrell and Leto did a great job. The acting of all of them was convincing enough and I think we had some of the greatest performances when compared with their past roles. Jolie was sexy (as always) and she really delivered. Her acting was great as did Hopkins and Kilmer. But flaws are not missing in this movie! Too different accents, Jolie is almost as old as Farrell and she played his mother, Farrell's hair, Leto's excessive make-up (too much eye liner)!!! The fight scenes were great but at first I couldn't understand who was killing who and who was winning ... it wasn't clear at all ... there was so much confusion! And the last thing ... I didn't really fell in love with the characters as we all did in Gladiator! This movie is kind of 'dry' in some aspects. I'm sure it could have been a masterpiece but it has certain things that are really missing. The movie starts with old Ptolomy (Hopkins) narrating the events of Alexander. At first we see the warrior as a young boy which became an obsession to a mother who is a snake fanatic (Jolie), who was also a crazy and cunning woman who desperately wanted her son to become a powerful king, than we meet the king (Kilmer) who was a beast and a drunk who slept with God knows how many women, there was nothing human in him. The movie than focuses on the different relationships of Alexander with his mother, the king, his best friend and lover (Leto), his soldiers when he becomes king after the murder of king philip. We see an Alexander who faces war and its bloody side, the glory of conquering the known world, marriage with a woman he doesn't really love (his true and only love was Hephaistion (Leto)) and betrayal."
30707,"Wonderful Film; A brilliant, thoughtful film from Clint Eastwood. The 3 main performances are very realistic and excellent and the acting is deliberately and delightfully underplayed. The theme of a women boxer may seem trite to UK audiences but stick with it - it's worth it. Eastwood has a role befitting his age and his trademark minimalist style. Freeman's acting , as a seen-it-all ex-pro boxer, is sublime. But it's Swank who catches the eye in a role that she was made for. Its a typical Eastwood film - slowish with artful camera angles and empty spaces. The central setting is a run-down gym and this is beautifully realised. Also typically for Eastwood , the film has more plot than one would imagine from the first hour-or-so of set-up."
7209,"Tati leads..all others follow; I remember first watching this film and taking some time to get into it  no dialogue; quirky, catchy music and this totally odd character played by Jaques Tati who bumbled around causing comic disasters in his wake. It was only later that I realised that so many comics in the decades to follow had learnt and copied so much from Tati. Being from Ireland, I'm not an expert on US comics but in the UK, there have been so many whose influences are obviously wrapped up in this great genius from France  from slapstick to surreal, his films are a blueprint for so many other characters immortalised by more familiar names. And no dialogue is a joy  it allows you to concentrate on the actions of the players, the framing of the shots, the sets and the fabulous sounds of the film. Sheer brilliance. Start with this and work through his other films  all will become clear."
30894,"Stellar Film; This was a truly unbelievable movie. To make a quick note, if you have doubts about going to see this movie because you read bad reviews from so called ""credited reviewers"", don't listen to them. They center on every acting detail and things that the normal moviegoer doesn't look for. Throughout the movie there are plenty of areas where even if you know somethings about to happen you jump anyways. The plot gradually builds throughout the first half of the movie and the second half just leaves you in constant suspense wondering whats going to happen next. Michael Keaton is stellar in his return to the screen. The fact that E.V.P. is actually real and it could actually be possible to contact the dead just makes this movie that much more enjoyable. From the beginning to the end of the movie you are in one area the whole time: the edge of your seat. The ending just caps off a phenomenal film and leaves you thinking. Come to the movie with an open imagination and get ready to see some excellent acting from Michael Keaton and others and I guarantee that when you leave the theater you will want to put on the A.M. radio and listen to the static but then quickly turn it off. I created my own rating system which estimates the number of times I could watch the movie again and again and still love it each time. For this movie the N.O.T.I.S.I = 50. I'll be waiting for it to come out on DVD."
8874,"***1/2 out of ****; Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" is not only the best horror film of 2004 but it is the best comedy as well. It is an often hilarious tribute to George A. Romero's 1978 horror masterpiece ""Dawn of the Dead."" This film is not only horrifying at times it also manages to be quite funny. The acting is very good across the board. The lead was an ideal choice. The script is clever. There are many sly references to other horror films. The make-up and gore effects are top-notch comparable to Tom Savini's work for Romero's zombie films. This film is on my top ten list for 2004. Any fan of horror will appreciate this film for its smart script. ***1/2 out of **** and 9/10. Highly recommended!"
3452,"Completely meaningless action and violence; Definitely one of Jet Li's worse efforts, with a story and main characters you are *utterly* indifferent about. A few action scenes are passable, but don't expect much bang for your buck here. The only real entertainment is provided by Delroy Lindo, as he attempts to get into a high-level money-making racket strictly reserved for respectable, suit-wearing, white ""businessmen"". My rating for this movie: 4 out of 10. Jet Li's U.S. produced movies (this one, Cradle 2 The Grave, The One) have generally been among his worst. Try out some of his Hong Kong movies to see some much better action, esp. as concerns the martial arts content."
4848,"Overrated!; Critics loved this film, but critics don't know David Lynch. This film is just more of the crap he gave us in ""Twin Peaks"". It's just a bunch of weird and random stuff thrown at the screen with quirky and strange characters meant to be intriguing, but, inevitably, is all meaningless junk with no point or purpose to it. It's like ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", where Lynch is the tailor telling the Emperor only an intelligent person can see his creation, when the truth is that he's fooling almost everyone, because there's nothing really there. To all the critics and fans of the film, I can only say, ""The Emperor is in his underwear.""."
59854,"The best John Wayne movie, besides The Shootist; This movie surprised me when I first saw it-I wondered where had it been? This movie is just flat out terrific, Wayne, O'Hara, all the supporting cast members, the story, the fact it's true(based on a true story), and that John Wayne is human make for a 9 in my book. (I give The Shootist a 10, as the best John Wayne western.) This is also a great love story, between Wayne and O'Hara-which is more realistic than most of these ""guys in war"" stories. Also, a tip of the hat to the part of the story dealing with nerve injuries and rehab, and the backdrop of America's unpreparedness in air power post-WW I, think about Billy Mitchell while you're watching this movie. Must see for Wayne, O'Hara, or John Ford fans."
8949,"Not a Comedy, and Not Very Interesting; I don't mind films that are character studies, but if it's a comedy, it needs to be funny. This film isn't. It also helps if the characters are interesting. This is a very pedestrian film. If I wanted to see this film, I guess I could have invited my friend who's an actor and my other friend who's a teacher to go on a tour of wine country. I'm sure it would have been as exciting and probably funnier than this film. With the glut of downbeat films about alcoholics and womanizers, I have to wonder if that was the topic of last year's ""Screenwriting Seminar"", because it seems like every writer has to have a film dealing with these subjects this year."
27706,"It wasn't the best; I have to say, this movie was ingenious, but compared to the books this movie went too fast. It zipped through the pages of Snicket's first two books. Though I love how (in the movie) everything seemed to fit. From the mysterious deaths by fire and the spyglasses. The books had more to them, but the movie did not. For example, when Count Olaf was going to marry Violet, that happened in the first book, not the last. And Olaf didn't get caught either. Besides that though, it was a great movie. I'll give it a 7."
26207,"The ending?.............(contains spoiler); the movie itself wasn't bad... but what is up with that messed up ending? They rape the girl for no reason, and then that's it? end of Movie? if anyone can offer some insight to this, please do so. to me it seemed like they had no good ideas for an ending, so they just said screw it and ended it anyway. i just don't get it. Please any thoughts, views, or better yet, actual comments from the filmmakers or facts would be great. Anyone? Anyone at all?"
31225,"I love love love love this movie!; I saw this last night...and it was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time!! I loved the soundtrack to it, they have some really cool songs, and it has a great story line. Plus Robert Ri'chard is one of my favorite actors so it's all good! I loved this movie so much, and I can't wait until I see it again! I even cried in some parts, like when Cruz's...wait I can't tell you guys anything!! That will ruin it! I Loved this movie, I can't say it enough! Please, Please, if you're a smart person, and I know that you are, you will go out and watch this movie!!!! Please, please go watch it...I know that some people said that it was bad, but they're stupid!! Stupid people! This was the best movie ever! ever! ever! Do you see how ecstatic I am about this movie? You should be too!"
27716,"Serious comedy; The art of the absurd is alive and thriving in current Danish cinema! Well, at least it is in this movie. Nobody in this movie are amused. They are all either annoyed or shocked, and if they aren't yet, they soon will be! It is a story of screw-ups, murder, embarrassment, dignity, and, in the end, love and redemption. The chilling, awkward humorous style is idiomatic and won't appeal to everyone, but personally I found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd. You pity the characters from a distance, even as you dislike them up close and personal. But their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them, even when they get away with murder. This is, in my judgment, definitely the best Danish movie of the last few years. 9 out of 10."
78062,"This movie was really good....what made it even better is that Corey Feldman was in it!; I thought that this movie was really cool. There were no bad actors in it and the best actor in it was Corey Feldman. None of the Puppet Master or Demonic Toys movies ever have anyone really famous in them. So I thought that it was awesome that Corey was in this movie. The movie isn't very gory but its still good without it. The goriest part was when the Clown in the box screamed and blew that guys eyes out. Anyone who saw the movie knows what I'm talking about. The only things that I thought was stupid in the movie is that the Baby doll from Demonic Toys kept farting. It got old after the third time for gods sake! But the rest of the movie was very, very good. I hope they end up putting it on a DVD soon. Well, thats all."
30818,"musical delight; As an old fan of Bobby Darin, I found it real easy to get past the age difference. I just closed my eyes and enjoyed the music. He captures the style and even does well on the voice. bravo! bravo! Spacy is just great, courageous undertaking. Forget the attacks on his ego. Ego is what the entertainment industry runs on anyway. I hope the portrayal of Sandra Dee wasn't too difficult for her to see; not very complimentary. Truth is probably somewhat softer. Her roles never showed her as a true adult, but old personal appearances and interviews gave her more depth. Bobby Darin WAS an egomaniac and couldn't have been easy to be around sometimes. The magic of Bobby Darin was all in his stage presence and his music."
8369,"Incredibly stupid way of wasting your time; I can't believe I sat thru the entire movie but maybe it was because of my wife. A whodunnit so-called-thriller edited MTV-style for the teens just to keep you believing that time is running involves 7 FBI wannabe profilers on a drill getting killed one by one in very ingenious and clever ways. You got no time to get in the mood, no time to get to know them better, no time to admire the shots and you wonder how the hell the killer got time to set up all the traps. At the end, I shaked my head in disbelief at the Talking Killer-scene...the whole movie is a pathetic attempt at the whodunnit-genre."
31555,"Absolutely Terrible; I wish I could give this film a minus grade. I couldn't believe that I ran across this film again. This film was released almost 17 years ago, but I still remember how terrible it was. It was that bad! This is one of my picks for all-time worst film. This terrible film wasn't only a horrible rip-off of ""ET"", but it had a dance sequence in a McDonald's. Isn't that enough information to understand how bad this film was? Even the little alien was butt ugly. I'm not sure what the makers of this film were thinking. Why they'd even try to make a cheesy rip-off doesn't make a lot of sense. It was more blatant in 1988, but even now it looks pretty crass. A Horrible film! Miss this Disaster!"
78170,"Ozu's economic exploration of the Depression; In ""Tokyo Chorus"", Ozu interplays two major of his long-standing themes - economic status and the everyday realities of family life. The plot is simple (warning, spoilers): A young salary-man loses his white-collar insurance job trying to cover for an aging colleague. Unfortunately, it is 1931 and the Great Depression means few other employment opportunities. He has difficulty covering the expenses of his family. After misadventures, he runs into his former professor-now-health-food-café-owner who promises him aid if the young man assists him with the café. Part of that assistance is handing out handbills in the street, a major loss of economic and personal status. Unfortunately, his wife sees him and is greatly shamed by the family's loss of status. Gradually, she accepts the need for sacrifice and also begins to assist in the café. During the large opening banquet at the café (guaranting it's success), the old professor receives word that the young man has been offered a teaching post, albeit one in a small and distant town. The movie ends on this hopeful yet downbeat note. Ozu does not hesitate to attempt to show us the realities of Great Depression unemployment. Indeed, he is more truthful than any comparable American movie of that time or ours. Ozu is willing to attempt to dig into the nexus between employment, self-identity and status that is prevalent throughout capitalist economies. This was his primary theme at the beginning of the Depression, in this movie along with his early masterpiece ""I Was Born, But..."" and ""Where Now are the Dreams of Youth?"" and ""Passing Fancy"". In addition, Ozu also flexes his unparalleled ability with family scenes. Excellent performances from Ozu regulars Tokihiko Okada, Emiko Yagumo, Tatsuo Saito, as well as a winning child performance from future star Hideko Takamine. Watch out for the world's cutest fat baby!"
30816,"Her heart belonged to Raoul but her soul belonged to the phantom; From the previews you would think this was done extremely well. Unfortunately, it was just the opposite and many things could have been done better and what did that monkey have to do with Raoul? I thought it belonged to the Phantom so why did he purchase it at the end ?I saw the movie with my daughter who is a voice major and she felt that Christina needed a lot more practice but her acting was superb. I was a little disappointed and would have enjoyed seeing more dancing at the masked ball but the best action scene was when the phantom cut the chandelier. That was worth while seeing on a big screen. Other then that I was a little disappointed with this movie. They show the best advertisement scenes on TV and then when you see the movie it's like what happened???"
30894,"Not bad but few changes would of helped; Well slight let down by the film, acting is above par and its really not to bad a shock film but it could of been so much more and kept within a more ""You know it might just be real"" sort of film. Things they should of done 1 get rid of hole TV pictures thing just pushed it to far into the oh yeah, also to much like The Ring idea, clues could of been done with more voice stuff or things like a breeze blowing pages of a book open with a picture of a place or ink leaking from a pen to form a image and so on. 2 flashes of the ghost like people in the real world did work well and much more could of been used adding quick shocks here and there. 3 killer idea at end yeah not bad twist but only if the three ghost like things just watched and did not take part as if they can pick our luckless hero up and break his bones killing him why on earth do they need the killer? they can just do it, much better had it been they just made people do stuff as they could not harm the living. As it is i give it 6.5 out of 10 but a few scares here and there and more in keeping with real would would have pushed it to a good 8 or 9 as nothing more scary if you think it could just be as shown in film but full on ghosts and TV bits soon take any chance of that away"
30822,"Fabulous Movie, Excellent performances; I saw In Good Company today,and I have to say it was fabulous. It is that rare movie that combines comedy and drama in such a way that it is totally realistic. I personally have great disdain for corporation takeovers, so I had no problem sympathizing with Dan. But Carter was not as confident as he seemed, and you could see he had a job to do, but was not ruthlessly ambitious. This made you feel some sympathy for him as well. Of course, this would not have been so easy if there were a different set of actors. Topher Grace (Carter) is fantastic. He has a naturalness to his acting, making Carter someone you would love to have as a son or son in law. Scarlett Johansson was perfect as Alex. She had just the right amount of vulnerability and spirit, as a young college student trying to assert her independence. Dennis Quaid,however, was just superb as Dan. He always tried to do the right thing, whether helping his children, his fellow employees or Carter, without being preachy. He was not afraid to show his emotions, and admit when he made a mistake. Dennis is so natural as an actor, you forget he is acting. I am a big fan of Dennis, and have seen him play every role imaginable,from villain, to hero, to comic relief and he excels at every one. However, he shines in roles that portray ""ordinary men"", like Dan, Jim Morris in the Rookie, Frank Whittaker in Far From Heaven,and Frank Sullivan in Frequency. This movie is a must see if you are a fan of Topher,Scarlett and Dennis. They really gave it their all. This is one movie you can see again and again. 5 out of 5."
31878,"Kung Fu Hustle is another great action/comedy by Stephan Chow; It seems to me that Stephan chows movies are getting better and better. Kung Fu Hustle is better than Shaolin Soccer in my opinion due to the fact that i'm not much of a soccer fan but Shaolin Soccer had a good story to it. Story-wise, Kung Fu is the typical Chow movie, but in a good way. The CGI was very good at times i couldn't tell the difference between real and fake. After the movie i was left craving for more of the action scenes from the movie because they looked so damn good, especially the first fight. I might have given it ten stars if it weren't for the fact that the story seemed to have been rushed. A little longer, more action scenes, definitely more chow jokes, and this movie should be more of a hit than it already is."
3697,"From Arnie to Danny Glover!? Big Mistake; Great movie made about a stealthy alien hunter that only takes on the best of warriors of whatever planet or race that it encounters. Predator starring Arnie a great SciFi action flick. so inevitably a sequel was going to be made. now who to star? Arnie not available/ didn't want to. hmm Stallone maybe ? oh wait I KNOW Danny glover! an ageing black guy who's co star in the lethal weapon series only did another sequel because glover needed the money. for god's sake the guy has to stop between take for an hour to catch his breath again. was Samuel l. busy? hell i'd have preferred will smith play rather than Danny ""im getting too old for this S***"" Glover. so fans of predator prepare for a disappointment Arnie beating the creature was barely plausible. Danny glover fighting one should be a foregone conclusion. but maybe the predator was an ageing out of work hunter? still its not bad. it could have been worse it could have been as bad as alien resurrection."
50229,"A Classic That Keeps Astounding, Ever More Absurdly, With Each Visit; Jacques Demy's THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT is such a special treat--so bright, light and airy, full of wonderful music and dance--that it's difficult to over-rate it or not recommend it. And yet. Demy is a cinema artist who always verged in the precious (in my opinion he rarely toppled over), and this may cause trouble for some. His ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" has always seemed to me a heavy-handed, repetitive, sentimental downer; ""Young Girls"" is very nearly its polar opposite. (Demy's wife, the wonderful filmmaker Agnes Varda, has overseen the reconstruction of this classic, and we owe her quite a debt!) Michel Legrand's music here is full of jazzy, astonishing riffs and lots of melody. Accompanying it are some delightful lyrics that are translated fittingly--if not precisely--into equally delightful English. Catherine Deneuve and her late sister Francoise Dorleac are wonderful in the title roles, and they're helped immensely by the likes of Danielle Darrieux, George Chakiris, Grover Dale, Gene Kelly (yes, an American in Rochefort!), Michel Piccoli and a young and exquisitely beautiful Jacques Perrin. The dancing is a joy, as well, as you'd expect from a film that offers Chakiris, Dale and Kelly. Characters sing of their lives and lost loves, and everything--from the pastel-painted city to the gorgeously coordinated costumes--is as unbelievable yet as wonderful as an enchanted dream. I remember enjoying the film when it first appeared. Now, it seems not only of its time but ahead of that time and so special and perfect that I suspect certain of us will want to revisit it every few years, for as many as we have left. In a word: transporting."
30822,"The Movie is a 10!; I just went and watched this movie this afternoon... and I absolutely loved it! It is now ranked as one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIES! I base movies on the feeling I get from them.... what they make me think about afterward... and this movie really allowed me to feel what the characters were feeling! Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson have a magical chemistry that is really shown in this movie! Dennis Quaid is such a great actor and he just plays this role so well. I would have to say that this is definitely an amazing movie and I am going to recommend it to all of my friends... and offer to go see it with them! I think its amazing how some actors bring you into the film, they really let their emotions out and it makes the movie just hit you!"
73111,"There Was a Crooked Man...; Terrific mix of comedy/western/prison film about clever thief Kirk Douglas who lands himself in jail after robbing a rich man of $500,000 which he's hidden in a mountain. Honest, forthright sheriff Henry Fonda becomes warden of the jail with the intent on reforming the prisoners not punishing them. Kirk Douglas must plan his escape with the help of some colorful prisoners by bribing them. Very underrated and overlooked gem of the 70's wonderfully directed by Academy Award winning director Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Full of humor, excitement, and entertainment. Cynical and funny script has some great twists and the cast is perfect. ***1/2 out of ****"
2640,"Is it a turkey....no, it's Super, man.; With the opening credits being the only true anchor into the time in which the film was made, the film of Superman then plays out as one of the best made 'comic book movies' of the 20th century. With its sweeping natural vistas of real cornfields and clouds, the viewer starts to get a taste for at least one third of what old time radio listeners of Superman heard as, 'Truth, Justice and the American Way'. And as this film is two and half hours long, there's no need to worry, there will be more than enough time to get to sink our teeth into a lot of 'truth' and 'justice'. This certainly becomes true when we see the young Clark Kent (Jeff East) hiking up North to create his own fortress of solitude where he is surrounded by 'Just Ice'. Young Clark heaves a green crystal rod (looking suspiciously like the rod that happens to attach itself each week to Homer Simpson) a good distance across the frozen North Sea until the crystal lands on some frozen ground. The crystal then melts into the water and disappears. This green crystal then reappears in a very different form when added to the salty water of Earth, as it creates a gigantic rock candy crystal fortress for Supreman. It is here that Superman learns the 'truth' about his past through the turning of many other clear crystals. These clear crystals conjure up the floating image of a white haired Marlon Brando as Jor-El, Superman's father. Jor-El explains to Clark all about what to expect out of the new life Clark is destined to live and even answers all of Clarks questions hundreds of years in advance. This process takes 12 earth years or 7 minutes of film. Once Clark understands fully his mission in life, he then heads to Metropolis (as played by New York: see 'On the Town', 'Midnight Cowboy')to land a paying job working as a newsman. He gets the job and starts his dual life as the mild mannered Clark Kent by day and the overtly colorful costumed spandex Superman by night. The film is pretty much a series of close calls from people falling out of helicopters, buildings, bridges and dams. There are also many of the obligatory 'damsel in distress' episodes between Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) and Superman. I've never been someone who understands the appeal of Margot Kidder. Wasn't there an actress in Hollywood at the time of the making of this film who would've been better choice for Lois Lane? Anyone? Perhaps a fast talking Barbara Stanwyck type from 'Meet John Doe'? Or maybe a 'take no prisoners' type like Rosiland Russell in 'His Girl Friday'? No? No one? How about anyone of those two I just mentioned at their advanced ages? Not to be too harsh, Kidder did an o.k. job, I just don't see her as Lois Lane. I think that even a 14 year old Teri Hatcher would have been better for the part....well, maybe not. For me, Kidder was the one person who dragged the movie down. I would have mentioned Valerie Perine as Eve Teschmacher to be another culprit, but she isn't in the movie long enough to matter. For the most part, Perine luxuriates underground with Lex Luthor(Gene Hackman) in a plethora of costumes, most notably a top that pushes much of her talent up and out, well within eyesight of those who don't need to posses x-ray vision to see her blossoming talent. Which brings us to what is really good about the film. Gene Hackman is brilliant as Lex Luthor. Besides the selection of Christopher Reeve as Superman, this casting choice was by far the most inspired. Hackman teams up with Ned Beatty who plays Hackman's right hand man, Otis. Otis is pretty much a comic buffoon who messes up almost every plan that Luthor dreams up. You have to wonder, why if Luthor is so brilliant, does he surround himself with such incompetent help? Their scenes together are worth the price of admission. I wished there were more of Hackman and Beatty in this film. Glenn Ford is good in the little time he has on screen as Clarks adopted father. There isn't enough time on screen for Susanah York or Terence Stamp to leave their stamp, but that would be rectified by the time of Superman 2. Jackie Cooper as Clark's boss at the Daily Planet is pretty average. Seeing Marlon Brando dressed up as Jor-El carries with it a sort of embarrassing charm. We also see Trevor Howard on screen for less than a minute, talk about a 'Brief Encounter'. All in all, I enjoyed watching the movie unfold. Christopher Reeve is by far the best Superman to hit the screen. A gifted actor in other dramatic roles away from the Superman movies, Reeve also brought a very light touch as a comic actor to the role Clark Kent and a commanding presence in the role of Superman. 8/10. Clark Richards"
32291,"Worst film of the year?; Having seen this film recently in France, I had at first assumed my reaction to be a result of a normal inability to comprehend entertainment across cultures. However, I've been reassured, it just stinks. Vapid and vacuous dialogue, unattached and untalented performers, and a trite ""literary"" plot make this one of Woody Allen's most infantile and uninteresting films to date. The film is difficult to watch, as one is so utterly annoyed by their inability to care for a single moment or a single instant in the fate of any character's plight... Mr. Allen seems to have written himself into the dialogue of each character, having Ferrell deliver such lines as ""I'd hate to take you home and then find out that we differ on a Tax Annuity issue..."" Poor portrayal of women, poor portrayal of men, poor acting and direction... Save your money."
3148,"Great Adaptation; If you've read any John Irving novels, you'd probably know they're pretty lengthy and hard to adapt but The Cider House Rules did it very well. The story is pretty much about a youth trying to find out who he is and what he wants from life. Tobey Maguire was great as Homer Wells and it seems like he can do no wrong with the 'cute, nice guy' roles. Charlize Theron was fine but I didn't really become a fan of hers until 'Monster'. Michael Caine is probably the best thing about this movie other than the beautiful score. Also, not a lot of people give enough credit to Paul Rudd. He made Wally so sympathetic and nice that you feel terrible about what Candy's doing to him while he's fighting in the war. I had some trouble believing in the Candy/Homer romance, mainly because Candy seemed to love Wally so much that it just seemed wrong that she would sleep with Homer just because she 'can't be alone'. Overall, I 'd give it a B+"
74859,"Great Cast in Underrated Gem; Wonderful music and terrific English performers make this spoof of 30s musicals a must. Twiggy is wonderful as the understudy who must fill in for the injured star (Glenda Jackson in a funny cameo). And a Hollywood big shot is in the audience.... Hmmmm. Superb turns by Antonia Ellis as Maisie, Christopher Gable as Tony, and the rest: Max Adrian, Georgina Hale, Moyra Fraser, Barbara Windsor, Bryan Pringle, Catherine Willmer, Tommy Tune, and Murray Melvin. Great sets and costumes and all those musical numbers. Twiggy (yes, she can sing and dance) and Tune teamed up on Broadway years later in Me and My Girl. And this is the show that made a star of Julie Andrews on Broadway in 1954. Great Sandy Wilson show made into a glorious film by Ken Russell. His gentle spoof of 30s musicals, including the famous Busby Berkley dance routines and many inside jokes and lines from 30s musicals make this a total treat for fans of the genre. Jackson's ""now go out there and be so great.... you'll make me hate you,"" is a direct quote from 42nd St, where Bebe Daniels says the line to Ruby Keeler. Also with Graham Armitage, Caryl Little, Sally Bryant, Brian Murphy, Vladel Shaybal as DeThrill, and Peter Greenwell as the pianist (who won an Oscar nomination for his orchestration). What fun! And one of Russell's best films. Ken Russell takes a straightforward show and adds layers by having characters imagine bigtime Hollywood versions of the small touring company's musical numbers. This opens up the movie and makes for a dazzling spectacle of music, dance, and color. But without terrific performances, this would all be for nothing. Twiggy is really good as the shy Polly the stand-in. She and Christopher Gable make a nice dance team in several numbers. Max Adrian and Catherine Willmer are hilarious as the troop manager and his wife Hilda, as are Moyra Fraser and Bryan Pringle as the haughty star and his wife. My favorites are Antonia Ellis as the ferocious Maisie, Georgina Hale as the fog-horn voiced Fay, and Barbara Windsor as busty Hortense. The music is great. Twiggy gets to sing ""You Are My Lucky Star"" and ""All I Do the Whole Day Through."" Hale and Adrian are memorable in ""Never Too Old to Fall in Love."" Fraser and Pringle are fun in ""You Don't Want to Play with Me Blues,"" and the closing ""Doing the Riviera"" is a fond homage to Berkley with the famous chorus girls on winged plane number. Also love ""The Boy Friend,"" ""We're Perfect Young Ladies,"" ""Nicer in Niece,"" ""A Room in Bloomsbury,"" ""Fancy Your Forgetting,"" and ""Sur La Plage."" THE BOY FRIEND is a fond and loving spoof of old-time musicals and beautifully done. A must-see for all fans of classic musicals. 2011 UPDATE: Warners has issued a remastered DVD and the color in spectacular!"
7375,"Danish Rip Off; To be quite honest with ya all - being Danish probably spoiled it for me. If they had just pretended that they we're Norwegian or Dutch or even Swedish I would have survived. But no. I mean, seriously. If they're gonna pretend he's Danish they gotta do their homework. Get a speech coach, for one thing. I mean this is a Hollywood production, right? U can do better than this, people! I can see why they have to put the evil spin on the queen to actually add some suspense to the story, but no, I don't imagine the Danish royal family to be like they're represented in this story. 'And why should they?' you might ask. 'It's fiction'. True. But when it's ur own country it's all about you get a bit touchy. AND I thought it was a bit of a 'Coming to America' rip off! Prince from far away country that no one has heard of goes to America to... Yeah, u get my point... I hope :) But I will choose 'Coming to America' over 'The Prince & Me' any day! Maybe because I'm not from Zzimbumbe or whatever the fictional (?) African country Eddie Murphy played the prince of in this classic movie ;)"
6754,"just an awful, awful movie; this is probably one of the ten worst movies i've ever seen. terrible acting, laughable special effects, and a squandered story-line which had the potential to be cool. the fact that an undead vampiress can drown sums up the complete stupidity of this movie. last time i checked vampires don't breath. anyway, avoid this one like a vampire avoids sunlight (oh yeah, sunshine bullets, how incredibly lame is that?). the look of the film is a total matrix rip-off, but the storyline and characters in ""underworld"" made me long for the the second and third matrix movies (which is an accomplishment only a shamefully bad movie could pull off). a 1 out of ten, and that's being very generous."
30894,"Finally a Scary Movie; Seems nowadays everyone is trying to make scary movies but the thing is, none of them are scary anymore. Nothing since The Exorcist (when i was in 7th grade) has scared me or was particularly good. Most scary movies never turn out to all they are hyped up to be or follow a different story line than advertised. However, White Noise was truly the best scary movie in a long time. It was realistic, kept moving, scary, and makes you jump. The story is easy to relate to so in a sense the viewer is able to put him or self in the movie with any of the main characters. A ~>must<~ see for scary movie fans!!!"
4389,"A moving story of first love; The movie ""Lost and Delirious"" was without a doubt one of the best depictions of young love to hit the screen yet. This movie is a must see for anyone who has ever been in love. The story of two girls in love and the social pressures that surround them in an all girl boarding school. Most people would say, ""Why do we want to know this story?"" I say because it is heartfelt and a true telling of the emotions swirling around same sex relationships. As individuals we all long to belong somewhere, to know that someone loves us despite the horrors around us everyday. To Paulie, this is who Tory is to her. She knows that as long as she feels Tory's love for her, life is worth living. Their love is secret of course because so many don't understand what it means to ""just love."" Into the secrecy of their relationship comes Mary B. or Mouse, who befriends them both and cares for them each as a friend despite knowing that they are a little more than ""friendly."" Adding to the confusion of emotions Tory's little sister Alley bursts in one morning to find her sister in a precarious position...in bed with Paulie. From here out the relationship between the two girls is strained. Tory feels the pressure of her parents's dreams and expectations for her and is unable to acknowledge her love for Paulie fearing that her family will no longer love her and she will be forced to be seen as ""not normal"" by all her classmates. So in essence Tory chooses to shut out Paulie to avoid speculation and in doing so unwittingly causes Paulie to slowly descend into madness. Paulie of course takes the situation to heart, after all they are in love and that should be enough to overcome anything. But instead she finds herself alone...well except for Mary B. her loyal friend. I love how the story is so real especially in the connections of the schoolgirls. Let's face it we all went to high school, private or not and it's brutal. Mary B. is loyal. She sticks with Paulie even though the other girls begin to talk about her as if she is ""one of them."" The classic scene is at the mail boxes, she responds with ""Paulie is my friend, so I guess it doesn't matter what everyone else says!"" However, she does witness Paulie falling apart and is torn with how to help. You see how hard it is for Tory to step away from Paulie, but the real heart breaker is in how Paulie deals with the rejection of her first real love. She feels as if the world has ended and the sun will no longer shine if there is no more Tory. She tries to win her back, but only causes embarrassment to Tory through her wooing. If you have ever loved someone and for whatever reason others saw that love as wrong, your heart will break when you see this movie and you will weep. Sadly, Paulie is unable to cope with the rejection of Tory, and Tory is not able to step beyond her own insecurities and prejudices of others to comfort Paulie. So Paulie gives into the madness...the overwhelming grief she feels from the loss leads to her undoing. In the end it is Tory who is left to deal with the love they once shared and all that could have been. Mary B. learns through Paulies' folly how to pull herself out of the madness that can swallow us all if we aren't careful. This movie is moving, your heart will not escape the pain, but perhaps it will teach you too how to pull out of the madness around us all and in turn show us how to love one another. For love just is."
3739,"Good, but not great comedy; I saw this film at a revival theater in Cambridge.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I must say that is a bit overrated (the audience may have been slightly at fault-there's nothing I hate more than the sound of false laughter from people who have come to a film expecting it to be witty and sophisticated and afraid they will appear laughing if the ""don't get"" the jokes).  I have read several reviews that hail it as ""the greatest sound comedy"".    While it is very entertaining, the first half is somewhat slow, and the plot is very generic.  The writing can be very witty, but I would say it is somewhat spotty.  Overall, however, this is a very enjoyable film.  The ending is about as perfect as an ending can be."
3316,"8 on a scale of 10; I liked this movie much better than the average viewer (obviously - as the average is a paltry 5.5). When you have crime thrillers, there are several variables that must come through for it to be a success - not the least of which is the surprise ending. I was surprised about 3 times at the end, so no matter what else I thought about the movie, that carries a lot of weight. I can't say that I liked every aspect of the ending, but overall it was satisfactory. The movie had a very unique and interesting notion - one that I have not seen in a movie before. It was violent, but not overly so. It was gritty, but had romance. It was cold, but ... Well, there is no ""but"". The whole movie was in frigid conditions. Not exactly Pearl Harbor. Affleck was the star along with Sinise and Theron. All were good enough for a movie such as this - where action and suspense rule the day. I want to single out Sinise, however. He was very good as a bad guy - really a good job of acting. I might not have always believed Affleck's character, but I never doubted Sinise's. All in all, a good movie - and free at that!"
3472,"So Black and White!!!; This is a great film. It's so Black and white - it's probably the most Black and white film I have seen for ages. First thing to remember though, when you watch it, is forget about the script. The story is thin and full of holes and amazing coincidences - and not even in the late 50s New England did Americans talk like that - it all sounds so English! (and I'm a Brit). No American cop ever said ""May I?"" when asking to be handed a possible piece of evidence. No, what makes this film great is the photography, the composition and the editing. Some of the edits are superb. There is one cut in particular that knocked me out; as the girl (Nan) is driving in the car in the fog. The interior shot is composed top to bottom of 3 bold bands: Black White Black and the exterior (as she stops and asks directions) the scheme is reversed: White Black White. It's stunning stuff. I would bet that parts of this movie were story-boarded to the frame. The burning at the start is great and though the use of sudden close-ups gets overused through the film they do work well for the most part. The atmosphere generated in the first half of the movie is spooky, unsettling, weird. It's a pity that all this effort is wasted on a pretty mediocre story which just falls apart in the middle and gets silly beyond words at the end. Definitely worth watching though."
27857,"A wonderful and Moving Film; This film, recently voted as an audience favorite at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival, is inspiring and moving. A famous conductor, forced to retire by illness, returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir, and finally find fulfillment in his music. Drawing on Sweedish traits of keeping things within oneself and of the insular character of a small Swedish village, this film develops each of its characters well. superbly directed, acted and sung, it brought tears to many eyes, and smiles to all. Hopefully it will find distribution in the United States. If you can, see it!"
8985,"A little like...; yea the movies has some features similar to the matrix, overall a great movie, and i would give it 11/10 if I could, and by watching the ending of the movie, you can tell that number 4 is on the way! I was saddened by the death of good old whistler i mean, i thought he died during the sequel and seeing him again in this movie was good yet confusing, will he be back in number 4? I also felt sorry for the blind lady because the way she died was so awful, so gutless, and i really felt sorry for her and her daughter. Jessica Beil was great however i think Ryan Reynolds was being an ass throughout the whole movie and i think that triple H kept up his ""everyone hates me"" reputation by being an asswhole throughout the whole movie, but these things are what make a good movie a great movie!!!"
1213,"One of the best  and most entertaining films of the 90's; Goodfellas was one of the first great crime movies of the 90's. The 90's was an extraordinary decade with crime films like Silence Of The Lambs, Reservoir Dogs, L.A. Confidential, Fargo, Pulp Fiction, Se7en, and The Usual Suspects. Goodfellas follows the life of Henry Hill(Ray Liota) who grows up to be a gangster. The direction by Martin Scorcese keeps your interest in the film from the way the film starts to the way the film ends. He is really good with keeping the flow of the story going and not letting it drag out or go slow at any time. The film allows you to meet the characters and see what they are like, such as the cool guy gangster Jimmy Conway(Robert De Niro) and the hot headed Tommy Devito(Joe Pesci). The story follows Henry from the age of 14 on up. It shows how he becomes part of the mob, how he gets married to Karen Hill(played by Lorraine Bracco who later on played Dr. Melfi in The Sopranos). Other things happen throughout the story such as Henry having kids, getting involved in drugs, going to prison. The story really comes together when(spoiler ahead) the mobsters all decided to get involved in a heist. It seemed like the perfect plan until something goes wrong with one of the people involved. This is when things involving the heist heat up and most of the people involved in the heist get whacked. After this is when a lot of events from early on in the movie comes into play. Goodfellas is one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen. In just 2 1/2 hours it accomplished more than a lot of other mob films have. Director Martin Scorcese does a lot of good techniques to keep the film moving and make time go by without getting real slow. Everybody who wants to see a mob movie that is worth watching with plenty of entertainment should see Goodfellas."
7254,"Disturbing but definitely worth seeing.; Every once in a while a story involving time travel comes along that seems almost plausible. This is one of those stories. We follow the life of a disturbed child who suffers blackouts during times of high stress. The imagery utilised to portray these moments is sometimes haunting. Thankfully, the director has employed suggestion over explicit vision in these instances. As one would expect, the tone of this piece is dark and subtle yet it still jolts you about as you watch. The sharp editing indicating shifts in time is done brilliantly. The Butterfly Effect is reminiscent of Donnie Darko (though not quite as good). Nonetheless, I recommend grabbing in on DVD and turning down the lights. Ashton Kutcher does a fine job too. 6/10."
6383,"Such a great movie; Brian is such a ladies man in this movie as he is in every movie - Vin Deisel should so have been in this movie, him not being in it recked it. Tyrese Gibson did play a good role as roman Peirce and he was a great actor in this movie, very funny and tough, I think that he should be snapped up by a Hollywood asap as he is the ""must have"" person in any movie role he plays. The Cubans were being asses through the hole movie as was Carter. One question though, how did Carter know that O'Connor and Pierce were 'originally' going to the airstrip? And how did he know that Monica was a cop towards the end? The only problem with this flick is that there are heaps of loose ends that need to be tidied up, including some from the original movie. But then again which movie doesn't? 10/10"
3949,"Amazing; Just watched it about 2 hours ago. I think this one is gonna take a while to heal. Was watching it with my father, we didn't say nothing at all while watching it, glued to our seats. It bumped up my heart for about 5 minutes at the climax. The way they edited this film really helps out to shock the audience. That jump from one shot to another, with no smooth change, with that freaking awful music, the lights going on and out, the different shots they make, just amazingly well done. Just loved it. Really got the point of the movie i think, and i would recommend it to anyone who is willing to be shocked and to have a great bad time."
122296,"Great, excellent movie.; At first I was very skeptical of this movie. While watching it, the actors captured my heart. There dazzling performances made the movie so much better. This movie touched my heart in several ways. I am not usually very touched by movies. They are usually fiction and I am a verisimilitude person. I recommend that everyone see this movie. People of all ages will be touched by the themes and performances that are existent in this film. I have not seen such an exceptional movie in quite a long time. Stories and movies of this type are worth-while to me. I find these very interesting. If you know of any movies similar to this one please recommend them to me. It would be greatly appreciated."
2106,"It don't mean a thing...; This is a wonderful outstanding movie. When i first bought it i was a little skeptical because i had never seen it before. I really only wanted to see it because of Christian Bale. I ended up LOVING IT and watching it again the next day. This movie shows the struggle between two friends and how they can be split apart by politics and propaganda. I'm not the type that likes violence so much but i can tolerate it to a certain extent. This was just enough although i was very scared i was going to see something graphic because thats what the dramatic music did to me. There were a few wonderful dance scenes especially the last one. The Last song was great because it shows how Peter is going to be himself and he doesn't need anyone to be happy he just is, ""I know who my friends are."" In this same scene Thomas was also revealing his change. Thomas turned into the Anti-Semitist that loved to hurt and kill. He liked to see people bleed. At first he was a normal swing kid but then he became an HJ and a friend of Emil's and started leaving Peter behind. The acting is really outstanding. The character of Peter is portrayed so beautifully and when he wept so did i. With the character Arvid you can tell that he was really heartfelt and headstrong but a very likable person because he stood up for what he believed in. Their group also had a little sidekick which i don't know his name he really had no purpose other than to be there and i thought he would make some sort of comeback by the end but he didn't. There was also peters little brother who was so sweet he was like the little tag along and kept the swing alive he was a part of a new generation of swing... GO Little Brother! Although made in the 90s this is a great film and i think everyone should see it because you can take away a lot from it. Its outstanding and heartfelt... SWING HEIL!!!!"
3742,"A milestone in cinematic history!; I cannot explain how influential Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin has been during the course of the last eighty years. Eisenstein's use of montage is extraordinary, flashing from one idea to another, and back again so quickly that you don't even realize that it is happening! Based on an actual mutiny that took place in Russia in 1905, Battleship Potemkin explores revolution through splicing together powerful images in a way that can, at times, literally take your breath away. The sheer brutality of the soldiers opening fire on the civilians at the shore of Odessa is truly horrifying! The intensity of the scene is truly unforgettable. The audience witnesses the chaos that comes from social uprising; children and mothers gunned down, baby carriages falling helplessly down flights of stairs. These are the visions which will stay with anyone who sees this movie. This particular scene is quite moving and disturbingly graphic. I am not sure, though, whether it is the power of the images, or the brilliance of the order in which they were placed that makes this movie such a force. Through his use of symbolism, powerful photography, and ingenious montage, Eisenstein created one of the most important and influential films of all time!"
8799,"Trivia--Did You Notice?; Now I didn't sit through the credits to verify that I actually did see none other than GAVIN ROSSDALE (lead singer for BUSH) as the barista in the coffee shop that was flirting with her, but I'm sure it was him! It had to be...I mean, I had his poster on my wall for years, the one with his dog Winston? My heart fluttered, I adore that man. When things went sour with the guy she was with, I was hoping she would go back to the coffee shop and end up with Gavin, but no...of COURSE it had to have a predictable and crappy ending and run into her ex b/f Bean who was successful. I didn't much care for the movie, but I have seen much worse."
5022,"Subtleties; If you watch closely you will find that not only does the internal decoration of the house change (in ways not included in the plot) to become gradually darker as Tony is gradually undermined and seduced by Barrett but also the excellent (but very much of its time) soundtrack by Johnny Dankworth & (surely - or is my recollection wrong?) Cleo Laine - though the same LP is put on the turntable many times, the arrangement of the same theme is different. (I did not notice this at first but found it pointed out in a special issue of the Oxford University magazine Isis at the time the film was released that was entirely devoted to it.) The film has recently reappeared in England as a stage work: Play without Words, seen at the National Theatre, is (was, I guess, is more accurate) a superb piece of dance theatre in which the ambiguities of the characters' motivations, or the discrepancies between their thoughts and actions, are portrayed by having more than one dancer per character. Sometimes only one is seen, sometimes they move in unison, sometimes in separate ways. It is extremely effective."
31221,"Great movie with few faults; I don't know why everybody is giving this movie such a bad reputation my girlfriend and I both thought it was a great movie. There were few things I didn't like about it. For example, the story is kind of slow at the beginning but when it picks up it's very interesting. Another thing was that some of the deaths were really quick but other than that it's great. You do not need to see Daredevil to enjoy it. The only thing it has to do with Daredevil is the character of Elektra. There are no cameos of Kingpin, Matt Murdock,Bullseye or any other character. In my opinion it is much better than Daredevil. I give Daredevil 6/10 and I give Elektra 9/10."
30749,"Well Worth Seeing; For most of the last six weeks it's been impossible to pick up a newspaper or watch a news show without a story about people everywhere pitching in to help survivors of last month's tsunami in Asia that killed at least 150,000. Hotel Rwanda, a grim movie about genocide in Central Africa, shows how equally indifferent the world can be to human suffering on an even greater scale. In 1994, the Rwandan government, controlled by the Hutu ethnic group, which accounts for a majority of the country's population, launched a vicious campaign to wipe out the Tutsi minority. Before the year was out, more than one million Rwandans were dead. What was happening in Rwanda was no secret. News outlets were full of graphic and grisly pictures of Hutus murdering Tutsis, often with machetes, and fields and roads full of corpses. This time, however, the world did nothing. President Bill Clinton says it is the biggest regret of his political life. Hotel Rwanda is about one man who did act, and by doing so, saved more than 1,000 lives. Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of a luxury hotel. Paul has made a career of knowing how to understand and meet the needs of his customers and staff. He uses these skills to keep alive his family, neighbors, coworkers and others who come to him for help. Cheadle gives a wonderful performance, Sophie Okenodo as his wife is equally good, while director Terry George does a terrific job at showing the horrors of what happened in Rwanda. This is a movie well worth seeing."
7153,"Mind-blowing; The Return of the King is my personal favourite part of Peter Jackson's amazing adaptation of J R R Tolkien's epic, though only by a narrow margin. The three films are in a different league to anything else I've seen. I wasn't even remotely a Tolkien fan until The Fellowship of the Ring first screened - now I read his work avidly, and that's entirely down to Peter Jackson. I (slightly) prefer RoTK to the other two masterpieces for two main reasons. First, the scale of it is even greater than that of The Two Towers. After seeing the battle of Helm's Deep, I didn't think I'd ever witness a better battle scene on screen. Then came the siege of Minas Tirith in RoTK. While not quite matching the sheer horror of the night attack of 10,000 savage Uruk-hai (considering the meagre defences), the Minas Tirith battle is just mind-blowing in scale. The relentless march of 100,000s of Mordor orcs, supported by huge mountain trolls, catapults, Haradrim and the undead Nazgul on wings... is simply mind-blowing to behold the first time you see it. Second, this is the concluding part, and therefore more emotionally involving and satisfying. You would have to be stone-hearted indeed not to be moved somewhat by the mutual friendship and love between Frodo and Sam - and the ultimate fruition of their courage. Returning for a moment to the great battle sequence of this film, I would have liked some dialogue between Gandalf and the Witch-King of Angmar (as in the book) but I can forgive this small thing. There are other differences between all three books and the films, some minor and some quite major, but none really damage the films all that much. For instance, I'm actually glad that Jackson omitted Tom Bombadil from TFoTR - a major character but one I personally find quite tedious. Other highlights in this film include Frodo's passing through Shelob's lair, the fall of Osgiliath, a great scene at Minas Morgul where the Witch-King first unleashes his vast army, and Frodo's final arrival at Mount Doom. In short, like the other two films, this is not just great but in a totally different class to the majority of films out there. As for people who hated all three movies, I can only guess that there is something dead inside them - the childlike capacity for wonder and awe, plus the willingness to suspend disbelief, that is required to get the most out of this type of story. Some people just hear the word 'orc' and become offended by what they imagine to be subject matter beneath them."
8970,"This is a must see movie; This film came as a big surprise to me. I basically went to see it because Johnny Depp is nice to look at and it started when I could be there. John Depp was convincing as usual. However, I wasn't prepared for the degree of sensitivity given to his character. Freddy Highmore, the young man who played Peter is an amazing actor. There was nothing childlike about him. Ms. Winslit has done it again. I can't say enough about the movie or the players. Done poorly, this could have been a real snooze. Instead, it was one of the most beautiful films that I've seen in a long time. The only thing that bothered me when I went to see this movie was the strange little man sitting next to me in the theater. Every time John Depp or Freddie Highmore came onto the screen, this man made motions at the screen. I finally asked him who he was and what was he doing. He answered ... My name is Oscar and I'm knocking."
4262,"Tony The Blow-Man; ""Scarface"" is a useful movie to have around. If you walk into someone's house for the first time, and he quotes ""Scarface"" twice in the first 15 minutes, you know it's time to leave. After escaping his native Cuba during 1980's Mariel boatlift, former jailbird Tony Montana (Al Pacino) gets a second life in the land of opportunity, which he takes full advantage of as one of Miami's leading cocaine cowboys. Tony wants it all, including his boss's wife, his sister's devotion, and a mountain of blow to call his own, but once he gets it, he starts on a downhill trajectory with fatal consequences. The fact so many people like ""Scarface"" is testament to the intensity of Pacino's performance more than the intelligence behind it. In the DVD documentary, Pacino readily admits to the character being two-dimensional. For some, that's great. He's not too complicated that way. But for me, Tony Montana is worth maybe 20 minutes in a movie about someone else. He blows too hot. Pacino isn't great here. He has some good scenes like at the beginning when he's being questioned by some cops, but mostly he just yells a lot. The supporting performances are uniformly weak, including F. Murray Abraham, who gave one of the great screen performances in the following year's ""Amadeus."" Michelle Pfeiffer does the best work for 10 minutes, but then the script seems to lose interest in her character and she ends up throwing out some random histrionics before exiting stage left. The storyline is simplistic and uninvolving. The score is one of the lamest, especially during the opening sequence showing news footage from the Mariel boatlift. The motivations of everyone from Tony's early benefactor Frank Lopez to Hector the Colombian are at best opaque and at worst cry plot convenience. There's a silly bit of business involving Tony's sister and mother which is dragged out too long. And with Pacino's central character so unlikable, this is all too much to deal with. Is it director Brian De Palma? De Palma makes interesting movies, just not always good ones. He made some very good movies around the early '80s, and ""Scarface"" would seem like a prime candidate to be another. But it's like when he has a great actor to work with, like Pacino or Sean Penn in ""Casualties Of War,"" he loses the ability to rein them in and just lets them bolt through the fences. At the same time, De Palma often gets great performances from less-heralded actors, like John Travolta in ""Blow Out,"" Craig Wasson in ""Body Double,"" and Michael J. Fox in ""Casualties Of War."" He's not untalented, just maddening inconsistent. The film does have passion, and some momentum and excitement that carries into the final crescendo. There's a terrific sequence involving Montana and an assassination target that generates some real concern with the audience because you are actually meant to care a little about the people involved, and Tony for once is not acting according to type. But mostly ""Scarface"" is an '80s TV movie with marathon swearing and bloodletting, and a performance from Pacino that hopefully got it out of his system for a while. It's cathartic, maybe, but so's running someone off the road after they cut you off. Not exactly reasonable therapy."
8665,"Fantastic projection of an emotion; The mood is flawlessly transferred to the viewer when Bourne's only friend and love is so violently taken away from him and the audience. Revenge was the only option and I would not have settled for anything less. The story was great although Brian Cox's guilt could have been a little less obvious. Love those endings that leave your imagination wandering what's next. The way the director made me feel Jason's pain I think I could write the third. A great movie leaves you feeling like your real life is not real at all.Both of the Bourne stories do that perfectly. Now if you will excuse me, I have a martial arts and sniper class that I am late for and.......I think someone is watching me."
31225,"Great Sports Film; Coach Carter was an excellent sports film that will keep you interested the entire movie. Other than basketball, there are many sub-issues that are entertaining such as the players relationships with their girlfriends, the coach's life outside the court as well as many other things.I think this is one of the best basketball films since Hoosiers and any film-goer or sports fan would think the same. Samuel L. Jackson of course did excellent as usual. There were many new actors in the film as well that made there presence known. With the drama on the court, there was also some hysterical scenes which made people laugh and was a good mix into the film."
112846,"Home Alone Meets the Spy Kids; I'm sure that the producers of both the Home Alone movies and the Spy Kids films must have seen this one at some point in time. Bush Christmas combines good elements of both those film series and has innate charm of its own. Australia where they never dream about a White Christmas serves as the backdrop for the kid's adventure. Children are on a quest for stolen horses after encountering the thieves Good location photography out in the outback really sets the tone for the kids. No crazy special effects, but the Australian background accents the danger of the kids search. I wish this original version had been done in color, but that was all, but unknown in the nascent Australian film industry. I like the kids here because they are real. When you watch something like Home Alone or Spy Kids you can't forget you're seeing Hollywood personalities no matter how talented they are. These Aussie kids are real and charming. Finally to recommend this film is the presence of the first real star who worked and developed the Australian cinema. Chips Rafferty plays Long Bill, one of the horse thieves and even though he's the bad guy, he's a likable cuss as he is in all his films. At 6'5"" Chips is kind of hard to miss and he doesn't exactly have matinée idol looks. But whenever I do see him, I think he represents Australia the same way Maurice Chevalier became an international Frenchman or Harry Lauder is the quintessential Scot. He's tough, he's funny and he had to be the inspiration for Crocidile Dundee. He never gave a bad performance in anything he ever did. This one is recommended for Australians wherever they might be on this old globe of our's."
7318,"A Life-Changing Experience; As of now, ""The Passion of the Christ"" has made $600 million and has been seen by millions. The film has been out for a while, but I put off seeing it because of the violence. I finally watched it today and was blown away, incredibly moved by this piece of work. Although ""The Passion of the Christ"" deserves to be the best picture of the year, or at least nominated--it won't be. The movie's Christian message is too frightening to Hollywood. Tinsel Town's anti-religious bias is well documented. The acting, the Aramic sub-titles, the direction, scenic casting, music are all first rate. I felt I was there, in first century Rome. I felt every lash of the whip, writhed with each nail pounded into Christ's flesh. Anti-Semitism doesn't exist in this movie. Simon of Cyrene, a Jew who helps carry the cross, is one of the most sympathetic characters. If anything, where is the Italian Anti-Defamation Leaque? The Romans are portrayed as mindlessly, joyfully sadistic. The Jewish Sanhedrin are just corrupt Roman Collaboraters. Most of the Jews are horrified by Jesus' torture and death. ""The Passion of the Christ"" is a life-changing, extraordinary movie. It will have a profound effect on the world."
27801,"Old-style film-making with a hot new talent; Tony Jaa is going to be a big name someday. He's one of those once-in-a-generation type of fighters that leap off the screen, that need to be told to slow down because they move too fast for the film to capture. But, is a single star enough to light the night sky? I think so, others I have seen will disagree. Yes, you see pads, especially on bruising thigh kicks and elbows to the thigh. But, you also see the contact, and the neck blows (and there are tons) aren't padded. many of the fighters also wear wigs and toupees to protect their heads, which i don't mind at all. I would much rather see a pad than to see Jackie Chan's endless post-film footage of stunt actors being carted away in ambulances. I'm extremely glad he stopped showing that, as it, imho, makes me feel bad about enjoying the movie. I feel that great athleticism should be shown in a relatively safe form. This is difficult, as seeing pads and such detracts from the immersive film experience. But seriously, if you were there when Ric Flair broke his neck or ""The Polish Hammer""'s son dislocated his kneecap, ""real"" fighting often sucks. I also feel that people who rabidly only follow ""real"" fighting enjoy pain, not the beauty of motion nor the athleticism of gifted athletes. All that being said, this movie is worth buying (not just renting) for Tony Jaa himself. This guy is absolutely amazing, and for most of the film, you get the feeling that he could do more. Regarding the quality of the film itself: The stunts are first-rate and incredibly executed, and of course, Tony does almost all of them himself (the same can't be said for his co-stars.) The editing is pretty good, although I suspect that some scenes were cut for budget/time, and this made the storyline suffer. However, only 1 of the side stories. The main story is resolved almost flawlessly (where's the ring, Ting?) After watching artsy ""kung fu"" films like Crouching Tiger: Hidden Dragon, Hero, and House of Flying Daggers, my eyes were extremely thankful for natural city hues. Cave scenes i usually don't like, but here the earth tones were rich, blended very well, and provided just enough contrast between the different actors. The main criticism I have is: if you have somebody with the potential to become ""the next X"" (eg. jackie chan,) you don't need to follow his formula. You don't need a comedy relief guy. You don't need the waif girlfriend. You don't need the athletic contest to choose the best fighter in the village. But, all of these are minor compared to Jaa's greatness. Just like Jackie Chan's, Bruce's or Jet's early work, the actor is the only special effect you should need. I hesitate to call it a ""10,"" as this, imho, doesn't have the budget, experience, nor refined skill in film-making as Drunken Master 2, Fist of Legend, the Chinese Connection, nor Hit-man, all films i would rate above this. Also, Tony may never reach the pinnacle if he continues to abuse himself in such extreme ways as he does here. I'll give this a 8."
31221,"5 stars, I know it's early but so far the best movie of 2005; I went with a certain amount of trepidation, but I came out of this movie impressed with the way the story was told. Jennifer Garner is gorgeous and the villains were wonderful. Elektra is an anti-hero (a person who kills people, not saves them; but soon chooses a better path), so expect a lot of violence and action. The refreshing thing is that there is real dialog and real depth also in this surprising film. I recommend this movie to anyone who has got an imagination, a taste in movies, an action movie lover or a Marvel fan. Bottom line - go see this because you will not be disappointed. It is a fun action movie with a good story. Finally, a movie that was worth the admission fee. This is an action fan's dream that will keep you on the edge of your seat, while delivering an actual plot. 5 stars, I know it's early but so far the best movie of 2005."
7234,"A beautiful insight ... Masina makes the film her own; La Strada can sometimes come across as similar to the Hollywood films made in the 1950s, but for the most part, is a unique and beautiful story. It concerns a young woman, Gelsomina, being given to traveling ""artist"" Zampano by her poor mother in exchange for money. Zampano makes his money by traveling around Italy, putting on a strong-man show for crowds. Gelsomina has dreams of becoming an artist as well, and therefore was more than happy to go with Zampano, but Gelsomina quickly realises that Zampano is nothing more than a drunkard and a brute, with eating, sleeping and sex being the only things he cares for. The character of Gelsomina, played by Giulietta Masina, is the highlight of the film. With a face like no other, it exudes a certain beauty but is also very odd, with a definite quirkiness to it ""like an artichoke"". Masina is excellent as expressing emotions with nothing more than a look, and it is because of this that the film stands strong. The story itself is simple, but with Gelsomina being such a romantic at heart, she is constantly searching for love and an understanding of a world she doesn't know, being such a sheltered loner when living with her mother and four younger sisters. Zampano, the traveling strong-man, follows the basic of human instincts, irrespective of their bearing on others, namely Gelsomina. Anthony Quinn gives the character a great ignorance, Zampano being, for the most part, oblivious to the impact his actions have, only wanting to be able to earn money to eat and drink wine, and sleep with women. It is not until Zampano and Gelsomina (Gelsomina having become Zampano's sidekick in his traveling show) take on a position as part of a circus in town, and Gelsomina meets an acrobat clown, credited in the film as Il Matto  The Fool. She falls for his happy and carefree nature, exampled when he teases Zampano whilst he is trying to do his show. Zampano soon despises the Fool, and becomes jealous of the friendship forming between Gelsomina and the clown. This is where Zampano begins to show real emotion, and although he doesn't deal with the situation in the most appropriate way, it is the beginning of his life experience that changes him forever. The film is gorgeous, with some memorable characters, namely Gelsomina. It doesn't end on a happy note, but you are still left satisfied with the story told, especially the lesson taught to Zampano, although it was all too late for him, and it is not certain that he learned from the experience. Masina is an absolute delight to watch, holding you captive with her face alone, beaming with love. The film is not for those looking for Hollywood drama and action, but for anyone who knows how it feels to be confused and in need of understanding about life's ways."
30894,"Not worth watching; I hate when a movies trailer is better than the actual movie! Watching the trailer gave a misleading idea of the movie. The acting, directing is OK. The story? Why would anyone watch static all the time. Enough with the static, and who could interpit the static. I found the static theme hard to understand, and unreasonable force in order drive the plot. The movie is all build up with no ending. One expect a scary event, which never happens. What a let down for an ending. That is the best the writers could come up with! I felt like yelling rip off in front of everyone. I wonder if the makers did not know what to do with the ending. Build up with no actual scare. I would call this movie a tease. This film makes false promise, and can not deliver a decent ending. Two thumbs down. 5 out of 10. Do not even rent this one. A 4.99 DVD at Wall Mart in two years."
30822,"Overrated in every way - Avoid At all Costs; As far as movies go, In Good Company leaves a lot to be desired. I can't believe how cheesy it actually is. If you can stand the repetition and lack of inventiveness and don't care about anything beyond the ""eye candy"" value, I suppose this movie has the capacity to entertain. But, like most hollow, shallow entertainment of this sort, it's probably best seen after a number of alcoholic beverages. It's a car-wreck of a movie, the sort of cinematic disaster that one watches with a morbid fascination, the way some people slow down to inspect an accident scene. You keep asking yourself, how bad can it get? Unhappily, in this case it always manages to get still worse. Happily, it does eventually end."
175337,"A Really Good ""B"" Action Movie; Yeah, I know. Tom Berenger should be in better movies. This movie is your typical ""B"" action movie but the acting is much, much better. This time, he has to go back to Vietnam to assassinate a friend who has turned evil. Problem is, Thomas Beckett is older and his sniper skills are not as good as before. Something goes wrong with the hit and Thomas is forced to run for his life. Will Thomas Beckett and the Vietnamese policeman be able to get out of this mess? I liked the scenes of Ho Chi Minh City. I thought the actor that played the good Vietnamese policeman who puts his life on the line to help Thomas was excellent. Tom Berenger, as usual, has a lot of charisma and his acting is very good. Just looking at him, you feel that he is a haunted man who probably feels extremely guilty for doing what he does so well, and that is, killing people with a gun. This is a good movie to rent and watch if you're in the mood for a good action flick. I enjoyed this movie very much. But as I said, Tom Berenger should really be in better movie vehicles."
7439,"Long live The Punisher; ""The Punisher"" is a shining example of revenge and vigilante-style justice done right. It's also yet another comic book adaptation done properly. In fact, this may be the first time I wished we could give half-vaults, because it was just that good. In the compendium of comic movies, this falls just shy of the two X-Men movies, but it is right there with Spider-Man and easily surpasses Batman, Superman and The Hulk. The fact that it is an R-rated movie will kill any possible chance of decent box-office numbers, but it was a necessary step to take, and the quality of the movie just makes up for it. Hopefully this was Thomas Jane's breakout role, as he was outstanding and has the potential to be a contender to Ben Affleck, Hugh Jackman, Colin Farrell, and Matt Damon as the next middleweight action star. If you like action movies, check out this movie. If you like comic book adaptations, check out this movie. Heck, if you just like movies in general, The Punisher is two hours well-spent. Like Thomas Jane himself says, ""Frank Castle is dead. Long live The Punisher."""
27833,"Excellent John Sayles film, Silver City is a must see for the thinking American.; Silver City is John Sayles at his best. Starting right off with a politician who cannot think while he talks, portrayed excellently by Chris Cooper, the film rolls right into a murder mystery that keeps the momentum going to the last frame. Richard Dreyfuss plays a Carl Rove type master political manipulator after his own interests and those of his filthy-rich backers. When Danny O'Brien (Danny Huston) is hired to investigate/intimidate some of the local dissenters, his path takes us to the rest of the characters that make up this amazing and astute satire on current politics and the corruption therein. If you ever thought that money was not running everything in politics, this will help enlighten you. It is a delight to see Ralpf Waite in a fine performance as a mining engineer and Michael Murphy as the father of the candidate in the aptly named Pilager dynasty. Danny Huston carries the film on it's way as the man who strings it all together, an interesting portrayal of a man torn by his own self- doubt who, for a while, forgot to fight the good fight. He reawakens as the investigation reveals the underpinnings of down and dirty political interests that have nothing to do with public or environmental good. There is a great deal of subtle humor here, satire in very good form. This film is worth seeing on so many levels. Any one with two brain cells to rub together would enjoy this film, but for those of political astuteness, this is a must. It will make you feel good, to see and hear what you have been feeling for the last five years put into such an aware showcase. Everyone is the film puts in a fine performance. The scenes are in beautiful Colorado. The cast and crew, writer and director John Sayles and producer Maggie Renzi, have created a piece of art with social conscience, as usual, yet more progressive than ever. ""If you can't win the game just change the rules"" the movie explains. Follow the rule breakers while you watch Silver City."
2959,"Palahniuk is a literary genius and David Fincher translates 100%; This film is absolutely fantastic. Really, anybody who watches it and understands what is going on will be able to appreciate it. Despite the ugly truth behind the personality of the collective subject, you can actually walk away from this film feeling a certain level of rejuvenation. It is interesting how well Palahniuk's secrets are kept and how shocking the revelations are. It is amazing how dimensional the film is and how much more is revealed each time it is viewed. Definitely a powerful addition to any home movie library; one never to collect dust! The cast was well planned; as was the set, musical soundtrack, and the cinematography will shock you almost as much as the story itself."
5247,Every Boyhood dream; Smokey and the Bandit is every man's dream. To mess around with the law and get away with it! The vehicle of choice for the movie had to be something flashy to capture a young man's eye to purchase such as in the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious where the vehicle of choice in that particular movie was a Mistubishi Lancer Evolution 8. Over all I thought the movie was better than excellent for it's time. It also gave the public something to laugh about. As for the 2nd movie it should have been a continuation of the first movie where The three of them were seen heading up to New England to get the Clam Chowder. Over all I absolutely loved it!
30812,"Love in times of fear; Howard Hughes obtains every girl he can desire easily (if he has any time left amid lathering, aeronautic designing and movie producing), but he discovers a surprising affinity with Katherine Hepburn. For Hepburn this man is not ""too much mad for me"" as Ava Gardner will tell him later- because Katherine suffers also from some kind of disorder. Both little conventional young of slim elegance, an innate ambition and highest professional achievements, find in each other a companion with features that are not abundant in their respective environments. The similarity between these two protagonists is one of the keys for this film, but few have found it. The main personality resemblance being the predominance of a neurotic tendency. Is attraction or necessity what unites them? A nature dominated by anxiety seems to adapt defectively to other neurotic, although the expression of the anxiety are quite different; he suffers a phobic and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and in Kate although resulting in a less handicapping way- we can guess she is an eccentric person, in constant need for control and easily stressed when feeling that she is not as much loved as she aspires to. Both reach that point in which one interferes with another (""fame is my territory"" tells him, when some of the photographers turn their cameras away from her and aim them to him), but this would not be enough reason for breaking up as she will leave him for another notorious star that could also overshadow her (Spencer Tracy, her definitive love). The true reason is Hughes was not able to satisfy her necessity for security as Tracy would do (anyone that has seen Tracy's movies knows he is the kind of man that was born to give confidence). Neither Kate can render any aid to Hugh (when he is attacked by her family with wounding remarks she does not assist him: who is asking for help is not ready to hear others when asking the same). Two very similar people rarely could complement each other, but living together is impossible when their main feature is an under-laying fear, that arises constantly from childhood time. The need for a mate in this kind of people derives from the necessity of a truce in the sense of fear, and both will look for that relief in each other at the same time. I intended to deal only about one of the many aspects of the story."
8533,Great Heart Touching Movie; This movie is well worth to see! It's been a very long time since an excellent movie has come out about innocent love that really touches the heart. It's one of the rare one's you'll find like A Summer Story(1988) starring Imogen Stubbs and James Wilby. The Notebook will definitely take your heart away if you are one who understands and feel the emotions of one's dedicated heart warming true love. I thought I would never once again come across another wonderful movie about love and innocence that's just simply a heart touching love story. However The Notebook was a movie well done that covered everything a love story would make complete. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams played their characters extremely well. They both matched up perfectly in the movie. It wasn't one where the lady was too beautiful and the man just simply had to be replaced by a more handsome bold looking man or the other way around. This is definitely a must see if you are simply looking for a touching unforgettable love story. I plan on reading the book next since the movie was so great! It's usually agreed that the book version of any movie is usually (but not always) better.
27550,"Fair and Balanced for the first time; Hell House was a peculiar experience for me. I bought the movie on DVD at a small record shop, since I found the summary on the back intriguing enough. I'm glad I have it in my library. It's something that I know I will pull out when I feel like seeing something balanced. I'm willing to admit that I'm predisposed to a position on this sort of subject, although that does not cloud my judgment of what is actually a very evenhanded approach to this subject matter. In fact, I think I found myself more likely to get bored since they clearly aren't picking the best or the worst of each person's dialog. Some of the things that the subjects say are completely reasonable. We're all just a little clouded by the way we've chosen to view the world. In fact, the only viewer who would be truly bored by this movie would one who is not at all interested in the subject matter. On the technical end of the review, most of the others here have claimed that this has been poorly shot and edited. The editing could use a little tweaking, and I'd like some subtitles when appropriate, but other than that, I found nothing truly lacking in technical aspects."
3854,"A Must See Movie; Aimee & Jaguar, in my opinion, is one of the best films i have ever seen. I have seen and admired many films dedicated to love and the hardships of all sorts of relationships. This film has touched me in such a powerful way. I have read the book, own the film, and constantly listen to the soundtrack so that i may fall in love with these two tremendous women, all over again. Though in these times we do not experience the misfortunes of such bloody wars from the past, women today, whatever their sexual preference, are still struggling to be themselves. There are many great loves out there, all of them unique, but there will never be anyone hurt, devoted, loved, and admired as Felice and Lilly were and still are, to one another. This is a must see movie."
8949,"A Masterpiece that is one of the most beautiful and honest films ever made; ""Sideways"" is not the overrated film that many individuals (specifically A.O. Scott of the NY Times) claim it to be. It deserves all the accolades that it has received. This is a beautiful about real people struggling to find themselves even when they are suppose to know where they are. Paul Giamatti and Virginia Madsen stand out in the terrific cast. Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor have written such a smart and sharp film that it is funny when it is suppose to be and dramatic when it is suppose to be. But the film excels because it earns its honesty. It doesn't force sentimentality upon the audience and that is made evident by the last shot of the film, which is perfect. I truly have a soft spot for this special film. This is the type of film that to me does not come along very often."
8783,"weird...but very good; There were such bad reviews of this movie, I had to see it. I've been a huge fan his work. This movie is very typical of his design--unexplained scenes, foreshadowing and the ending that doesn't really end. You'll notice as you watch this that some things just don't make sense but he does explain them all and the plot twist is a jaw dropper. The ending is also much like ""Signs"". It doesn't really end-- there's no last battle where the villain is defeated. The true nature of the story is revealed and the characters go on about their lives. I think that's why people were so disappointed. I do have to say I didn't like Sigourney Weaver in this. She's an excellent actress, but she just didn't fit the character. Phoenix was great as always. If you love ""Signs"" or ""The Sixth Sense"", you'll love this. The story is a little slow, but don't worry, everything is explained and though Phoenix's ""color"" is never revealed, get ready for a few jump-out-of-your-seat scenes."
30825,"A bit over done...; Meet the Parents was an inspired comedy.It had a very funny premise,and delivered a bunch of great laughs.When the rumors for Meet the Fockers came out on the internet soon after,I was excited,I thought(and so did many other web pages) they'd use Ben Stiller's real parents,Seinfeld's Jerry Stiller,and Anne Meara,but they didn't.The film opens with Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker,who we all know by now is a male nurse,delivering his first baby.The father of the baby asks if he can the name the baby after Greg,he sees his name tag,and sees why Greg is hesitant.Well Greg gets to his apartment,where he calls his parents to remind,them that they are going.Well the rest of the day goes smoothly for Greg,and his wife to be Pam.They make it to her parents house.Where we find out Jack Byrnes is now a Grandfather,to Pam's sister's baby named Jack after Deniro's Byrnes .Pam's sister,and brother from Meet the Parents are absent in Meet the Fockers.They hit the road in Jack's camper,which looks like a tank,Greg even makes a joke about it.Along the way,Jack shows Greg his new invention,a breast feeding pump,that is molded from Little Jack's mothers breast,the joke is funny once,but they use it over and over in the movie.Jack discusses with Greg his legacy,and how he isn't sure Greg,or his family will fit in it.We now know that DeNiro's Jack hasn't changed much from Meet the Parents,and it progresses in Meet The Fockers.They reach Miami Florida,which is were we are introduced to Greg's parents Roz,and Bernie Focker.They are very different from Jack.Thats when the bulk of the film begins.Dustin Hoffman,and Barbara Streisand are great as Bernie,and Roz.They are very funny.Hoffman is particularly great as Bernie,a loving Dad,who has a Wall of Greg's Honorable mention ribbons.Hoffman,and Streisand have great chemistry as the loving Focker parents.But DeNiro's Byrnes goes a little too far,Robert DeNiro is an actor I admire a lot,but Jack Byrnes is an unlikable jerk in Meet the Fockers.He has a great talent for comedy too,Analyze This was a hilarious movie.But when you should be laughing at Greg's crazy actions,you actually don't think they are funny at all,and feel sorry for what Jack is doing to him,after trying so hard to earn his respect.There is one momment in Meet the Fockers,where Jack injects a truth shot in him,people in the theatre were laughing hard at it,but like I said earlier I felt sorry for Greg.Maybe I took Meet the Fockers a little too seriously.Maybe I should have relaxed and had a fun time.As for a third Focker outing,leave the parents out of it,and have it focus on Greg,and Pam starting a family. 2.5/4"

30816,Brilliant; An incredibly beautiful adaptation of the play. The only weak link seems to be Patrick Wilson as Raoul. I really wonder why Christine would have chosen him over the Phantom. Emmy Rossum was unremarkable as Christine but I would never say she was bad. I just have a personal dislike of those who are so blind. I was shocked by Gerard Butler's portrayal of the Phantom. Normally I'm not much of a fan of his but he managed this role to perfection. I definitely was floored that he can actually sing. This movie made me cry. A rarity for me. I've watched so many musicals taken from stage to the screen and usually I'm very displeased with them. Andrew Lloyd Webber has something to be very proud of in this movie as well as the play. Heartwrenching and excellent.
116189,"Sparkling 1930's Comedy; Jean Harlow and Robert Taylor in this wonderful, sparkling and enjoyable comedy makes for great entertainment. After reading two other users reviews, I had to add my own review. Watch, rent or own this film and it is worthy of adding to your collection. Harlow and Taylor make an excellent comedy team and the only disappointing thing I can say about this experience is that they didn't get to work together again. From the opening scene to the final denouement, the story is charming, and the wit bumps along at a great pace, no sluggish direction here, charming characters and stunning costumes make this a wonderful experience. If only they had made more comedies like this one. If there is one let down in the production, it is the fact that it is a little hemmed in with the sets which while glamorous and smart, are a little claustrophobic and limiting. The picnic scene could have added a welcome breath of fresh air if filmed on location, and a welcome break from the interior shots. I have enjoyed this film immensely and have given it a worthy 10 from 10. Harlow and handsome Taylor are a great looking couple, so glad to see them together at the end. Harlow sparkles as always in comedy and she is right in her element in this one."
8376,"Horrid; I couldn't even finish the movie. It wasn't that it had no plot, it was the fact that apparently when they made this movie the entire bunch were on Prozac. It was, quite frankly, depressing. It had some funny moments (such as when Nap slaps Kip and runs to get the door), but overall, I would definitely say, if you're suicidal DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. I'm not even suicidal and this movie made me want to kill myself. This movie is just horrible. There's not even words to describe how horrible this movie is. I'm telling you, go watch Pollyanna instead. Next time they want to make a movie with no plot and a loser character I'd suggest they lay off the medication."
4283,"A portrayal of a love for a city; At the opening credits of ""Roma"", we are informed by our narrator and director Federico Fellini that this is not a normal film in the traditional storytelling sense, but more a perception of Rome, the way Fellini sees it. Sounds interesting? Well, it is, in that one must be so in love with their city to want to show it to the world through a series of small stories and shots of random happenings. I can relate: I have the same love for Melbourne. We shift from a portrayal of Fellini as a schoolboy with dreams of going to Rome, to a depiction of Fellini as a young man, moving to the city he always wanted to live at. There's also scenes of early 1970s theatre attendance, the almost ritual-like eating habits of the Romans, and then we move onto a documentary-like part of the film where we get to see Fellini's camera crew struggle as they try to capture the hustle and bustle of the entrance into Rome via a major highway, filled with drifters, animals, trucks, hitch-hikers, bikes, and more. The constant changing in scenes and stories is a bit messy, and could possibly confuse those not understanding what Fellini is trying to do with the film. At some times, I found myself questioning whether what we were being shown was a realistic dramatization of Fellini's past experiences, or some kind of farcical take on Roman culture (see the religious clothing fashion show scene!). The film is quite intriguing, taking in the sexual revolution of the era and putting it up against a city full of tradition. We are also exposed to some of the city's dirty little secrets, such as the surprising popularity of their whorehouses. It can't be denied that there is something endearing to ""Roma"" that allows Fellini to get away with a film that doesn't really give you much to take home with you, other than an idea of what Rome was like for someone in 1972, and what kind of life was lead to come to those perceptions. It is somewhat self indulgent, but Fellini does put across the impression that he has something to show you, something he'd like to share with you, because he has loved it for so long, and it still fascinates him on a daily basis."
27434,"Creepy atmosphere, but not much else; A family movies into a house in what is apparently the Spanish countryside. The dad starts to go crazy, the young son has welts all over his body, and the daughter (Anna Paquin) tries to figure out what is going on in their new home. I don't feel I have the right to judge this movie because I saw the edited version that was theatrically released in the US in December 2004, not the original version. But I will say that this version is a mediocre and bizarre film that made little sense. The acting is surprisingly below average. It doesn't help that some of the dialogue is incredibly awful, which could possibly be attributed to language barriers between the filmmakers and the cast. Iain Glen laughably overacts as the dad-gone-berserk. Lena Olin is unusually awful as the mother in denial. Anna Paquin plays her character with such random lascivious looks on her face, that seem very out of context. Adding to the lewdness is the fact that in her scenes the camera often started at her crotch and then panned up. These scenes weren't like the kind in a typical sleazy horror movie. It seemed like they were done with some mysterious underlying purpose that the director never follows through with. The film does have a unique atmosphere and some otherwise beautiful camera-work, and a few decent scares. But it could have been so much more. Still, it is better than Darkness Falls. My Rating: 5/10."
2511,"It stinks!; That's right, stinks. It makes ""Heaven's Gate"" smell like roses. I hold Raymond Chandler in high esteem as an author, and ""The Long Goodbye"" is arguably his masterpiece --a heartbreaking tale of loss and loneliness. Altman's smirking revisionism was not appreciated by me. Unctuous, weaselly Eliott Gould as Marlowe? Give me a break! If Altman and company wanted to do a seventies take on noir crime sagas, they should have created an original character, as Towne did in ""Chinatown."" To play fast and loose with the source material, especially such esteemed literary source material, is inexcusable. Leigh Brackett should have known better and been ashamed of herself. Instead she and Altman chose to mock and sully an artistic achievement the likes of which they could only aspire to in their best work. Chandler deserved better."
8970,"Simply the best movie I have ever seen; I firmly believe that this film is the best movie I have ever seen or will ever see. The glimpse into imagination, into the world of never growing up, into Neverland is amazing. Johnny Depp plays Barrie with such innocence that you understand how he could have written the character of Peter Pan. His performance is incredibly subtle. A performance that truly sets him apart from any other actor currently seen. The young boy playing Peter is also amazing. He shows a more faceted performance than many actors twice his age. Truly an actor to watch in the coming years. The story is heart wrenching. Yet uplifting and beautiful. This film will last for years and never lose its potency."
30894,"forgettable ""dead contact the living"" flick; Jonathan Rivers (played half-heartedly by Michael Keaton) comes to believe his recently deceased wife is trying to communicate to him via modern technology. With the help of an Electronic Voice Phenomenon expert and a strange widow (the consistently odd Deborah Kara Unger), he tries to figure out what she is saying to him. White Noise is a by-the-numbers horror-thriller that seems like a mix between Ghost and Poltergeist (with no Oda Mae Brown and certainly no Tangina!). The film begins with a definition of EVP and, following the outlandish finale, concludes with some stats about the ""reality"" of EVP. This is probably the oddest part about White Noise, because the concept of EVP is hardly discussed in the movie. When the characters find out about it, they accept it without wondering what the hell is going on. The movie doesn't use the opportunity to delve into the issue of why the dead would try to communicate with the living through electronics. Come on, that's a pretty fascinating medium for the dead to choose! There is a hint of suggestion in one scene in the film, but it isn't powerful enough to leave an impression. Often, this seems like more of a commercial than a movie, filled with endless close-ups of cellular phones, boom boxes, televisions, and other modern tech commodities. Contrasting with these annoying sequences are rather beautiful shots of ultra-stylish architecture and crisp, orderly aerial views. These accomplish a foreboding atmosphere more so than the ridiculous close-ups of various electronics. The scares in White Noise are limited and hardly leave an impression. My Rating: 3/10"
8529,"I liked it; A typical Spielberg-like film with that special feeling that a good portion of the man's projects have possessed as of late. Tom Hanks' involvement was crucial. He's a very talented actor - that's no secret. I always liked him as a person and an actor, but it took this role for me to really recognize and fully appreciate his immense talents. Plus, I watched him on Conan O'Brien promoting the movie and he was fantastic. To add, it was a very clever film with several different likable characters. Definitely a good one to watch. - - -"
80619,"Shelley Winters gone wild; The sons of two very different women are convicted of murder. Fearing for their safety in their small town in 1930s America, star-obsessed Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) decides to get a fresh new start in Hollywood, and convinces the quiet and religious Helen (Shelley Winters) to join her. They exploit the Shirley Temple craze by running a successful instructional school that teaches child actresses singing and dancing. Things seem to be going well for both until Helen starts to have crazed flashbacks about her ""former life."" But things have never looked better for Adelle, so What the hell is the matter with Helen?! This movie is a hoot! Debbie Reynolds looks like a classic Hollywood starlet (fantastic costumes and makeup), and it is hilarious and sickening fun watching Shelley Winters in a downward spiral. Agnes Moorehead has an amusing cameo as a Radio evangelist with whom Helen becomes obsessed. The major drawback of the movie is the musical sequences. There are several, and while they do serve as a contrast to the more explicitly twisted elements in the film, showing entire song and dance routines is unnecessary (the scene where Reynolds tap-dances comes to mind here). It is also unfortunate that the film does not take advantage of the themes it presents. A deeper exploration of Helen's psychosis might have proved fascinating, scary, and even amusing. Overall, What's the Matter with Helen? is an entertaining psychological horror/thriller that does its job but gets weighed down by filler drama and musical sequences. Recommended to fans of ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" and anyone who entertained by Shelley Winters going crazy. My Rating: 6/10."
124160,"a cleverly subverted fairytale; From the opening scene, it is obvious that Rosie Forrest (aka Auntie Roo) is completely insane. She lives alone in a magnificent mansion in 1920s England and will never get over the death of her young daughter. In an attempt to fill this void, Auntie Roo has an annual Christmas party for a few of the best behaved children from the local orphanage. This year, a misbehaving brother and sister stowaway in the trunk of the car and join the party. Auntie Roo starts to believe the girl is her daughter, while the boy is convinced Auntie Roo is a witch. Mayhem ensues. This is a clever, creepy, and amusing subversion of the ""Hansel and Gretel"" fairytale that puts forth the notion that the wicked witch might not be inherently evil or even malintentioned--just severely insane! Some of the scares are cheesy, a few of the child actors are awful (the lead girl looks and acts like she was sniffing glue during the entire production!), and it is a bit disconcerting to sit through yet another movie where Shelley Winters sings and dances like a freak. But overall, this is an underrated sick little fairytale. My Rating: 7/10"
8652,"Brando shines in outstanding performance; The Night Before The Following Day is one of Marlon Brando's most over-looked films. Looking as fit and trim as he was in Streetcar Named Desire, Brando gives an emotionally charged performance as Bud (Brando's nickname in real life!), the leader of a gang of ruthless kidnappers. Brando's acting is at its best in an amazing scene in which he has an intense conversation with Jess Hahn about his misgivings regarding the success of their kidnapping. The supporting cast is remarkable. Richard Boone as a sadistic murderer, gives his finest career performance. His villain is the most chilling in movie-screen history. Jess Hahn, as hard-luck Wally, steals the show. He has the look and build of a man who has been dealt the worst of bad luck. Rita Moreno as Wally's drug-addicted sister and Brando's girl-friend, is at her rawest. And a young Pamela Franklin as the kidnap victim shines in a truly abusive role. Raw acting, graphic brutality, realistic action, a surprise ending, and out-standing acting performances makes The Night Before The Following Day a Marlon Brando classic."
7360,"The best Gore movie in quite a long time; First of all, let get clear, when you rent this movie you don't expect to see citizen Kane, if we keep that in mind, you would enjoy a really good movie that will keep your attention the whole 1:40 hours. We have a good story, characters that evolve, not a lot of insight on them, but thats OK, the movie centers in the life/death situation they are facing and the attempts they make to scape. The make up is excellent, and the camera work too, in the sum up is a decent flick for a Sunday afternoon, there is nothing like a little bit of gore to cheer you up I give it 7 out of 10. Enjoy the movie, but don't eat wile you are watching it"
1345,"the horror of menstruation; A sheltered teenage girl is viciously taunted by her classmates and abused by her religious fanatic mother. With the onset of menarche, she realizes that she has telekinetic powers. Like many horror films in the 70s, this one moves at a slow pace and culminates in a shocking horrifying extravaganza. Carrie was a personal favorite of mine when I was a teenager. Watching it as an adult, I look back on it fondly, but it isn't as exceptional as I once thought it was. I suppose I identified with Carrie and saw her as a sort of an icon. Now I am able to see beyond that and pick-up on other themes of the movie that are simultaneously frustrating (considering the film is both written and directed by men) and intriguing. Most significantly, Carrie's special powers are associated with her first menstruation, and ""becoming a woman."" Her mother treats Carrie's first period as evil--Eve's first sin is also Carrie's sin and she needs to repent for the rest of her life. Carrie ignores this at first, but ultimately believes that her mother (who we find is a ""woman scorned"") is right, as illustrated by the notorious pigs' blood scene. This is a much more complex theme than I initially realized, and it could be read as either slightly feminist or slightly misogynist, depending on how you interpret it. On to the performances. It is hard to believe the lead actresses were nominated for Oscars for their roles. Piper Laurie terribly overacts (apparently she thought the film would be a comedy, so this is likely De Palma's fault) and Sissy Spacek's performance makes Carrie seem more ""special"" than sheltered and abused. The movie does feature some incredible and innovative camera shots that are always fun to watch. I still enjoy Carrie, but not as much as I did when I was a mad-as-hell teenager. My Rating: 7/10"
5779,"It doesn't get much worse than this...; This movie is certainly in the top 10 worst I have ever seen. It was so bad that I had pretty much forgotten about it until I saw it listed on the ""Worst Ever"" list on here. An utter and complete waste of film. The only worse movies I have ever had the misfortune of viewing had to be the asinine ""Lost Highway"" and the ridiculous ""Pearl Harbour"". At least Pearl Harbour starred Kate Beckinsale. Pirahna II: The Spawning has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is worse and even as a child I remember telling everyone I knew what tripe this movie was. As A child, I laughed about it for weeks. As an adult I just wince at the memories. However, you may enjoy it if you like really bad movies. Unfortunately, it isn't so bad it's funny... It's so bad you want to kick your TV in after wasting your time watching it. Stay away. FAR away."
106094,"Rather cool, but really more of the same.; I liked this Godzilla movie, but it does share a few to many similarities with the previous Godzilla movie. On the plus side there was a longer fight sequence in this one, but in the end you really end up knowing the outcome of the fight well before it is over. Especially when they add Mothra to the equation, Godzilla was considerably weaker than MechaGodzilla in the last movie so I don't see why they felt he needed another opponent. They really should have added Godzilla some help instead. As it is, Godzilla gets his shots in, but not enough to make the outcome of the fight ever be in doubt. They do add a rather different ending to this one slightly reminiscent of ""Godzilla vs. Mothra"", with a twist. In the end though this Godzilla is just not nearly as tough as the demon Godzilla of the movie before the MechaGodzilla movies. In fact, this one isn't as tough as the two before that either. To bad it was not more like the demon one though as that one you could really pull against it, this one you feel sorry for. There are some returning stars in this as the pilot of the previous movie has a little more than a cameo, but this time the focus is more on a mechanic of MechaGodzilla. Good movie, but nothing new."
177135,"Zzzzzzzzzzz; It was the most dramatic event of the decade and probably as significant in the history of the new century as the Great War was in the old one. So how was it possible to produce such an up-tight, self obsessed, bad movie about it. Oh sure, some the camera work is effective...tight, gritty images of bad guys up to no good. But it never really comes to-get her. We don't realize who these people are, why they're doing what they're doing or much else about them. Nor is the surveillance of them in Germany and the US ever clarified. Is the film sympathetic to Al Quaeda? Not really. But many will jump to that conclusion. We all know how events unfolded on 9/11. Yet in this movie they are muddled and confusing. It could have been so much better if it had also taken up the story of some of the passengers and some of those killed in the collapse of the WTC."
1213,"Like getting a kick in the teeth (in a good way); ""As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster. To me, being a gangster was better than being President of the United States."" I might as well face it. I've become a huge mafia/mob movie fan. Sometime last year, when I worked at my local video store, I purchased The Godfather trilogy box set. I bought it because I felt it was just something I should have. Because I was a huge movie fan, I felt that I needed to own what was regarded as the greatest film trilogy of all time. Did I actually feel like sitting down for three hours and watching one of the movies? No way. So, it sat on my shelf for a very long time. One weekend at college, I was feeling very bored so I decided to put in ""The Godfather"" and watch it. Wow. I've been changed. This may be my favorite movie. Then came ""The Godfather Part II"" which was equal to the first one. I was captivated, because I was not used to film-making that was so consistent, raw, and powerful. Francis Ford Coppola's movies opened the door for me to see film, as well as society, in a whole new light. I'm new to Martin Scorsese, but after being amazed with his movie ""The Aviator"", I decided to rent his take on the Italian underworld, ""Goodfellas"". This movie is amazing. Simply amazing, because it is an example of absolutely pure film-making that hasn't been tainted by time or the latest trends. Scorsese had plenty of opportunities to screw up ""Goodfellas"" with clichés and cheap film techniques, but he decided to stick with his roots and make a picture that was instead fueled by simple, un-adulterated ""camera on actor"" (for lack of a better term) power. Scorsese understands the language of film more than probably any other director still working today. He is amazing, because every shot that he sets up is set up for a reason. He never does anything weird simply for the sake of being weird or drawing attention to himself. Everything that he does is done to tell the story and only that. In ""Goodfellas"", Scorsese does not glorify the life of the mafia. If anything, ""Goodfellas"", is a decidedly anti-mob movie. You see everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, that goes on in this underground business. The film is very very violent, but it is never out-of-line with the story. The characters are violent men, and therefore should be portrayed that way honestly. Roger Ebert calls this ""the best mob movie ever"" and while I disagree with him there, ""Goodfellas"" has earned a very high place on that list. Four stars (****)"
31221,"'Elektra' is decent for what it is, but more of the overall quality crashes than lands...; Elektra 'Elektra' starts off with a bang and ends with a bang... but the middle is where it loses steam... After being brought back from the dead, vengeance seeking warrior legend Elektra(Garner)becomes an assassin. She is hired to kill a young girl, Abby an her father, Mark. But Elektra finds out more about the family, and The Hand won't let them escape alive... or without a fight... 'Elektra' succeeds most when Garner is seen in her sexy Elektra costume. The movie is driven by the Abby side-plot that doesn't give enough to the film, most of the time causing it to fail. The action sequences are ""elektryfing"", but they barely make up for the cliché-ridden scenes in between. Jennifer Garner is good as Elektra, but the film would have been much better if the whole thing with Abby and Mark was left out. Whenever Abby was on-screen, it seemed to loose its steam. So, for action junkies, see it for the fun action scenes, but don't mind paying attention for the scenes in between... Elektra- 2.5 out of 4"
5218,"Cool; This is pretty good. They were creative about setting a movie 20,000 years ago. Beginning at the migration just before the Ice Age, we meet 3 animals who have 3 very different personalities & goals (4, if you count Scrat the squirrel, who pops up every now & then as we watch him struggling to bury his acorn). Manfred is a solitary woolly mammoth who just wants to be alone. Unfortunately, he meets Sid the sloth, a whiny, pesky, insecure creature whom he saves from a pair of vicious rhinos. Now he has to suffer Sid hovering around him while he heads north, away from the migrants. Meanwhile, a group of saber-toothed tigers are concentrating on attacking a human tribe, & hunting their baby as revenge for them eliminating 1/2 their members. Diego (Dennis Leary) is appointed to the job, & fails when the child's mother escapes w/him. Now bullied into tracking him down by his fellow sabers, Diego meets Sid & Manny, who's just rescued it from drowning after his mother dies. Trying to return him home fails - the humans have abandoned camp & gone onto Glacier Pass. Now, to please (& be rid of) Sid, & to make sure Diego doesn't ""return"" him alone, Manfred marches further north. As the 3 gradually become friends, Manfred & Sid walk on unknowingly toward 1/2-Peak (en route to Glacier Pass) - & a trap Diego has planned not just for the baby, but for the others too! This movie is funny and touching. A story of stupidity, wisdom, loyalty, bravery, friendship, love & humor!"
30707,"This film broke my heart........(that's good); This film broke my heart. I saw it two nights ago, and every time it enters my mind (which is every 5 minutes or so), I well up. I don't even like boxing, but that is not what this film is about. To me, it is a love-story of a would-be father and a would-be daughter. It is about a girl with nothing, wanting to prove that she has self-worth and a deep yearning to find a father-figure that is proud of her. However, this movie is about so much more than that. The lighting, editing and sparse scoring are perfect. I long so much to help Maggie, and feel that she is REAL, not just a fictional character from a movie. I have NEVER been this moved by a picture, and if any film should win just about every Oscar this year, it is Million Dollar Baby. Clint, thank you for reminding us what real movies are all about: Character Development. If there was ever a movie that fully embodied the ""American Spirit"".....THIS IS IT!!!!! thoughts? SvK"
1464,"The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen; I remember when I read a review for this three-hour test of my patience and sanity. Words like ""terrifying"" and ""provocative"" leaped off the page making Lost Highway sound like a modern masterpiece of horror. Unfortunately, David Lynch and the critics that praised this complete waste of time were obviously on heavy doses of LSD. The first 15 minutes start off OK. In fact, if Lynch had of followed the direction the first few scenes took, Lost Highway could have been an OK film. But alas, the plot quickly takes the downward spiral and just keeps gaining speed until it resembles a bad acid trip. The plot is not even illogical; it is non-existent. I have seen the cast in previous films, but nothing seemed to be able to save this film from becoming a kaleidoscope of nonsensical scenes, irrelevant plot twists, and sub-standard acting. I watched it through to it's anti-climactic 3 hour conclusion expecting at some point for it all to make sense, and ended up feeling that I had wasted three hours of my life I would never get back. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. It has justly earned the title of ""The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen"". Please, just bypass this one and avoid torturing yourself."
105465,"DVDs Reviewed; When I saw this film back in '72 I was impressed with the high production values, cast, characterizations, and special effects. Imagine my excitement and disappointment when several companies (notably one calling itself the Platinum Disc Corporation) put out editions which were simply a dupes from an old 3/4 inch tape: A battered broadcast print version which used to circulate among the independent television market many years back. The icing on the cake is a missing segment during the tea party sequence (approximately 20+ frames were snipped, most likely because of a tear in a badly handled print). In addition the film was originally shot in widescreen (2.35:1 ratio), but the tape, and subsequently the DVD, is pan-and-scan. These factors are coupled with a grainy image and scratchy sound track makes watching this otherwise fine children's film a real chore. The upside is that another company, Force Video, has recently released a remastered widescreen version of this family favorite. Regrettably, at the time of this writing, I could only find a region free version in Australia, but hopefully a world wide reissue will not be long in the offing. But, as with every upside there's always a downside. And regrettably Force Video's version is no different, because where the image and soundtrack of have been restored to their original glory, the video transfer is little lacking. Not much, but it's there. And even though the disk itself is region free, the information is formatted for PAL-CAM video. Which means you'll be able to watch it outside of Australia (and the U.K.), but only on a high end multimedia display or computer monitor, both of which'll show some of the transfers shortcomings (the image is somewhat jagged around the edges, and the sound fades in and out on the left channel). But even with those limitations, it is by far the absolute best release of this film to date. Versions to avoid; 1) Platinum Disc Corporation; this fly by night firm cranks out discount DVDs for the sole purpose of grabbing the dollars of the uninformed. Before seeing any DVD at a price that looks too good to be true it's because it's either a pirate or a Platinum Disc issue. And true to form their edition of Shaftel's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" is no different. It's merely a dupe to DVD from the old broadcast print. Avoid this one at all costs. 2) Screen Media Films; it's pretty much the same print as Platinum's, but there's a little more footage prior to the film's proper beginning, showing Republic Picture's ""Eagle"" footage and Gold Key intro. Truth be told this film is about 1% cleaner than Platinum's. It's barely noticeable, but if you're familiar with how films are made, and give both versions a careful screening, you can see where some frames are slightly cleaner than the poor release. In the end it's a wash as both versions are just as bad as the other, though the DVD transfer is marginally better (I guess the company felt that gave them license to say their version was ""remastere""; even though it isn't). Avoid this one also. Screen Media seems to have gone to some effort to get a better authoring of this film (verse it competition), but the film itself still isn't as sharp as it should be. In addition, even though the sound track has been cleaned some, the score still wavers, meaning the track itself has suffered damage (probably during the initial telecine transfer some 30 years ago). Though, for what it's worth, you don't really notice it when the actors are speaking, just when John Barry's hauntingly beautiful score is playing. On the other hand Force Video's version has crisp audio, even though there's still the left channel anomaly I mentioned earlier. The film itself, staring the then very young and very pretty Fiona Fullerton, tells Lewis Carroll's story, and does so in a very compelling way by immersing the viewer in a surreal world. Showing the audience a world full of wonder from a child's perspective. Fullerton herself, as talented as she is, strikes me as being a bit old for the part. Checking her data shows that she was 16 years old at the time of release, which means she was either 14 or 15 during principle photography. For myself that still seems a bit old for an actress attempting to portray a little girl, but Fullerton's acting ability sells the role to the audience. Combined with a very talented supporting cast the characters are brought to life in a delightful rendition of Carroll's tales. Shot in Todd-AO 35 the film image has a kind of rustic feel to it that adds to the mystery of the world Fullerton's character must discover. In short, the film itself is very much worth viewing, but if you come across a version that's priced under ten dollars American, then do yourself a favor and check the back of the DVD case. If it isn't presented in widescreen don't waste your time. Wait to find a better version so you can enjoy it with your family :-)"
3783,"Croupier; Quite the spectacular film. Very realistic, tons of motifs and for all of you analytical types, has some subtle motifs to be caught the third or fourth time around. Some graphic scenes, but not too much. I find that the movie puts things into sudden perspective. It almost throws you into this casino-dealers life and makes you feel like you know him. The protagonist seems simple but as the movie progresses one detects a subtle complexity to his nature, especially when confronted with difficult choices. The end is the best part; after the film you'll be wondering, ""what are the chances."" Very Entertaining. Expand your mind."
3603,"The Gay Deceivers(1969); If seen now by young people who weren't old enough to have lived during the Viet-Nam War, this film will seem ""small"" and out-dated. But, when this film was released in 1969 at the peak of the war, this was not only a very funny film, but a sad reality of the society of the times. Sad in the fact that some draft-age males would make believe they were gay to avoid going to Viet-Nam. Made slightly before the Gay Liberation movement, this film gives a surprisingly sensitive view of the gay lifestyle and gay community of this era. Micheal Greer gives an academy award winning performance (he wasn't even nominated)as the gay landlord, Malcom DeJohn; in one of the screens funniest, yet sensitive performances. DeJohn is best remembered as ""Queenie"" in the brutal prison film, Fortune in Men's Eyes. The stars of the show, Kevin Coughlin as Danny and Lawrence Casey as Elliot give fresh, intense, and emotional edged performances as men living with the fear of the war lurking over their shoulders. Also wonderful supporting roles by Sebastian Brook and veteran character actor Jack Starrett. The Gay Deceivers captures a time in American history that has been forgotten. Yet, today's headlines have made this film worthwhile today. The Gay Deceivers is not deceiving at all, I rate it a 10 out of 10."
3565,Giant Walmart ad; This move was one big Wal-Mart ad. It seems like half of the movie is spent inside the Wal-Mart store. I saw this with my wife a while ago and it was quite dumb. I have seen some great movies in my time and this definitely wasn't one of them. The moral point of the movie was to love people who are idiots because we are all idiots but they didn't accurately show consequences for actions and had too many 'main stream' values instead of real ones. There just wasn't a lot of substance to the movie. The only reason it made any money was that it had Portman in it.
30707,"Good acting but generally overrated; I wanted to like this movie, especially since I am a fan of Clint Eastwood as a director and Hilary Swank as an actress. The previews didn't interest me at all - but the almost universal praise heaped on this film did make me want to see it. I agree with the reviewer who said the film felt ""scripted"" - not only that, but watching scenes (near the beginning) with Clint and Morgan were like watching people ""act"" and ""play the scene"". Hilary Swank saves the day with her performance, believable and truthful. Clint's work later in the film is exemplary. Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman, and here he plays simply a variation on his ""Driving Miss Daisy"" character, mumbling through some scenes making his words incomprehensible. I didn't feel an emotional connection to this film at all - I don't see it as ""Clint's masterpiece"" at all - ""Mystic River"" is a far superior film, which had me extremely emotionally involved. The Morgan Freeman voice-over really got on my nerves very early on. I am not a fan of voice-over - I believe it's an easy way out of explaining things rather than SHOWING them. I can't understand all the hype about MDB - I really can't. I give it (a very generous) 7 out of 10."
8370,"New age , samurai  , tap dancing  , digital blood ...classic.; I enjoyed this movie. it is basically a revenge story with a few sub plots.It all takes place in a town run by two rival gangs...and when the main characters show up...the gangs history catches up to them. Very good acting and I like the one blow sword fighting style,the digital blood is fake but effective in a artsy way. The occasional heavy violence is balanced out well by the comedy and the bizarre. Takshi is as always worth watching,and it is obvious they all worked hard on their swordplay. Very worth while watching."
8981,"Closer Winners!; Closer stands out as one of the most powerful and riveting movies of the year marked by awesome performance deliveries. Clive Owen and Natalie Portman just snagged Golden Globes, and justly so. So many responses are pouring out on this message board that this movie is ""garbage."" I can only assume there's got to be correlation between hating this movie and voting for Bush. I think most of America wasn't ready for Closer, and was shocked by it. I just love how raw emotions can be portrayed so well. This movie is intimate, passionate, and raw. Not for all, but for those who just want to let go. Closer... it's good, and you need to see it if you want something outside the boring box"
2872,"A Master Piece Movie; I give 9/10 for this Wonderful movie. Even if it were create at 1981, even in 2005 it don't take age. One proof how good this move is. And even if I hate Monarchy and find it idiot, in listening this movie I forget that. We find all ""Legend"" in this movie. Arthur, Morgana, Lancelot,Guenevere, Perceval, etc. And of course Merlin playing by the excellent Nicol Williamson. In fact all actor/actress (Nigel Terry - Arthur, Helen Mirren - Moragana, Nicholas Clay - the enigmatic Lancelot, Cherie Lunghi - the beautiful Guenevere, Paul Geoffrey - Perceval, etc.)are Wonderful. And the story if very Original. Again something so rare today where they are just money who is important and how fast we can do that. What pleasure to watch this Master Piece. A classical movie that serious people who like movies must have in their home."
3354,"death scene; First off it was a MOVIE people get over it. Second, although you only use fuel starting and stopping in space it takes a lot either way. (Anyone remember Newton's Law of Motion?) They were entering a planets gravity field so it would have taken more fuel, lots more, to ascend higher in orbit. Since MMU are calibrated for one user the fuel consumption would have been much greater on the return trip. The cable would have been fighting the gravity well as well. (?) As far as the decompression goes, well did you really think they were going to show him explode from internal body pressure? Come on people it wasn't rated for that kind of gore."
7318,"Explore yourself !; People say the movie is graphic, also question if Christ existed,but this movie makes you realizer certain facts,and those are: Offcourse there was a a Jesus,if you look at the moon and the earth you know that there are things that a human mind does not know yet,so it is our ignorance that makes us ask the question of there is God. Movie is graphic: if we know that God took the sins on himself then at least we can share his pains in a movie ! It makes me think if I have learned from His suffering? We are still living in the same ignorance as in the days Of Jesus ! Have we learned anything? I am a Hindu but Jesus is also my God as rest of my thousands of God. Christians know your God and realize your Spirituality !"
31221,"I cannot remember when I was last bored so much; I didn't know much about the story or the rest of the movie before I was in the theatre. I expected something like an action movie with a vengeance motivated female warrior. And the introducing action scene looked a little bit like that. But at the end: the movie is not worth to be seen, not even on DVD or for free. A vague story about ""good against evil"" and a superhuman female warrior in the center of this fight. Could be interesting? Maybe, but it isn't. The action scenes of the movie are approx. 10 min in total and not even good. The audience waits in vain for something worth to see. The character ""Elektra"" is superficial and uninspired. I cannot blame the people who left the theatre before the end of the movie nor the people chatting next to me, because it was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen."
30816,"Still singing the songs...; I just saw this movie tonight and I still have the songs playing in my head. I have seen Phantom in New York at the Majestic Theatre and also in Tampa just recently. As I don't want to compare the stage musical to the screen musical, as you can do more in a movie than on a stage, I think it was absolutely wonderful! I have been listening to the music from this show for many years and I always forget how captivating it truly is. I loved that they updated the songs with the full orchestra and there were times when the characters were singing that you wanted them to take you with them. I thought Butler was almost too handsome to be the Phantom. He did an outstanding job and contrary to what I've read on a few other reviews, I think his lower voice was perfect for the role. I'm sorry, but when you think of scary people, you could imagine them having a deep voice. Emmy Rossum was a beautiful Christine and as I know many thought she was too young to assume this role, I think she was perfect. Christine is really supposed to be young and emotional anyway, and she did it very well. I'm happy they got away from the nasally, airy sound of Sarah Brightman. Shocking how a 17-year-old with no vocal training can have more substance in her voice than a mature woman for which the role of Christine was probably written. Patrick Wilson's voice was mesmerizing and really gave the role of Raoul some ""umph"". Minnie Driver as Carlotta was a bit surprising because just sitting down thinking of a casting list for this musical, I would have never in my wildest dreams have thought of her as the diva. I was very happy to hear that she decided not to do her own singing voice and actually gave trained vocalists some credit by saying that opera is not something you can just pick up and learn how to do in a few months. As a vocal major in college, I very much appreciated her giving classical singers some credit there. I thought Jennifer Ellison, who played Meg, was a great actress, but her singing voice sounded like one of my elementary students. I thought she was supposed to be about 20, not 8. Natasha Richardson was wonderful as the Madame Giry and I loved that accent! I have read in a few other reviews about her being the only actress that used a french accent, and I kind of wondered about that myself. I found myself feeling very sorry for the Phantom at the end and can actually admit that I cried when Christine gave him the ring back. I know she had to have loved him in a special sort of way. I mean, he had been with her since she first came to the opera house. I think her love for him was more like how a daughter loves her father. I mean, if you really thinking about it...Madame Giry and the Phantom were probably about the same age, according to the movie since she helped him escape from the traveling freak show and Meg, who is probably about the same age as Christine, is Madame Giry's daughter. So, that would make the Phantom about 20 years older than Christine. Anyway, I know how it ends since I have seen it before, but I can't help myself thinking that maybe they'll change it and she'll end up with the Phantom. Oh, well. It was a absolutely superb performance and I will definitely be going again to see it!"
3739,"Thoroughly unsentimental, hard-edged, strongly sexual, 1932 comedy classic from Billy Wilder's idol Ernst Lubistch; Why isn't this film out on Video or DVD? It is a masterpiece of subtlety and wit that has to be out there for people to study and learn from instead of being 'out of circulation.' Can you imagine Chaplin's 'Gold Rush' or 'Modern Times' being out of circulation? No. Well, this is a better overall film than anything Chaplin ever put out and mawkishly undermined with sentimentality, but only film buffs  who go to rare screenings get to see it. It is not so much a laugh riot like Chaplin's best bits as it is extremely clever, to the point of being transcendent. Its tone reminds me very much of Jean Renoir's 1939 'Rules of the Game,' and Bunuel's comedies, although it doesn't have Bunuel's 'cruelty' (as master critic Andre Bazin would put it).  It is just a work of art which most 'non-artsy' people will dismiss as 'just another clever comedy' because works of art annoy them (and they don't see why they should be bothered with applying the energy needed to understand them), while 'artsy' people will overrate it, and rightly so. Overrated or not, Lubitch's film is a joy to behold; you are glad it exists. As you're watching, you know you're being hit with valuable not-necessarily verbal information left and right. You know it's worth reseeing many times because you will get a different blend of perspectives from it everytime (much like a great piece of music). The essence of what makes it 'great,' as opposed to 'just another comedy' is this:  'Trouble in Paradise' completely destroys harmful romantic myths while affirming true romanticism (think Stendhal, Proust, Lessing, Nabokov) in the very way it is made, its style. This is what it does and it is an extremely important and purifying process for those who go through it and implicitly embrace its implicit principles. But, as it is, nobody'll get to see it anyway because it's not out on video, so what the hell am I writing for? To get all 3 of the people who will read this page in the next year to demand that it be put out for public consumption. Long live democracy!"
8643,"Re-make proves to be watch-worthy...; I will admit I like Hilary Duff. She's perky and giggly, and certainly sweet. So when I bought this movie, I was expecting a light and fluffy movie. The movie was light and fluffy, but it was also endearing as well. Duff shined in this role; definitely her best one yet. She played Cinderella (aka Sam) perfectly and with such innocence and poise. Chad Michael Murray was the surprise of the movie, however, playing Prince Charming (aka Austin) with all the charm and charisma you'd expect from one. The music was an added touch to this cutesy film, every scene memorable in it's own way (particularily at the end during the football game). Jennifer Coolidge's character was the only disappointment in the movie. Fiona could have had so much more depth to her character in this film and the way she was portrayed clashed with the overall feeling of the movie. Who knew that if you substituted a glass slipper with a cell phone you'd get such a wonderfully sweet re-make? Definitely recommended to those that can watch a movie with girl-y fluff."
4640,Takeshi at his meanest and his best.; A Japanese gangster is exiled to the United States where he moves in with his little brother...together he starts up all the drug/turf control troubles he just left when he and his brother try to become bigshot dealers. The highlight of this move is the action and violence...and after that Takeshi is the best thing this movie has going for it. Lots of fast action and gunfire. Omar is OK in it but Over the top in his acting...the half brother is very good. If you like good action with high production standards watch this one.
30816,"A great reenactment of the Broadway Musical; Andrew Lloyd Webber did great credit to his outstanding musical production with this movie. It gave more breadth and depth to the story and it was far easier to understand who was doing what. The singing was sensational and very clear. You could hear the lyrics and follow the story. This was worth the time to go see, especially if you like ALW and the Broadway musical. There seemed to be some new music in the movie which was not as compelling as the original score. Emmy is terrific and brings a lot of passion to the part. I loved the sepia treatment of the historical times and how they were able to highlight the flashbacks from the current life of Raoul. I only wish they had given a bit more info on Christine and Raoul's life after the Phantom."
30816,"Simply awesome; I saw this movie for the third time yesterday. All I can say is I love it. It gets better with each viewing. I have only 2 complaints 1) The whole Masquarade number looks like Madonnas ""Vogue"" video. 2) the whole graveyard scene is entirely too long. I find it surprising that Gerrard Butler learned to sing for this role. he is wonderful and just oozes sexuality. The 2 young lovers are very good also. I guess I have seen them before, but didn't know it. Now I will never forget them. But I highly recommend this movie."
4387,"Kiss of the Dragon: ""Love, Martial Arts Style""; A disarming (no pun intended) love story with appealing underlying themes with high ideals. Li's contribution to the screenplay provides an engaging contribution to the progression of emotions with Ms. Fonda's character. Li's oriental flavor, which does not require the western rhetoric, pulls us in after indifference becomes pity, and commitment enters caring. A Chinese policeman's ideals are like our childhood memories of a boy scout, and Li plays the eagle scout to the max: trustworthy, brave, reverent...and of course he is always good to his word, Fonda: ""...but...you promised."" Li:""Yes...I did."" Karyo, who I first so loved in La Femme Nikita, is excellent as a sadistic power monger, especially with those dying words, ""Kiss my ..."" Well...you know. I love the Karyo's recurring ""Johnny Boy"", which Li appropriately showed to irritate him as I am sure it irritated many of Asian descent. I love the music, the pace of the film and it's emotional ending. It's a shame that the average ratings reflect those not looking to find a good love story, but more action. They missed an ""excellent"" film."
4887,"Average sci-fi/actioner with above average plot; I wanted to dog this movie, but somehow I can't find it in myself to do that. Exhibiting a duality of fighting styles, it's Li vs. Li in a somewhat decent battle for supremacy. This is one of those movies where the story carries the performances. Li's acting is extremely amateurish, hesitant, and stiff for most of this movie...right up to the very end. At first I tricked myself into believing he was just doing that for one of his two characters. You know, to show a difference in personalities. But it appeared to be inexperience or a lack of talent. It did get a bit better, more relaxed, toward the end. But that wasn't enough to save his performance. Jet Li's acting does improve as his career moves forward. I don't hate his acting. I just hated him in this. I also have to say that the effects were very ""B"" class effects. What effects there are. The story itself had great potential. It was uniquely creative, daring, and fresh. Unfortunately, either the budget was not ample enough to accommodate better lighting, effects, film quality, and some acting lessons, or the director just did not care enough to bother with these little details. He also did not bother with the SCIENCE in the science-fiction. A fact which was a great detractor to this film. The fight sequences were a bit one sided, as he seemed to give more to one character and little to the other. But all in all the story line made for a very enjoyable attempt. As enjoyable as this was, I couldn't help but think, all the way through, that this was just one of those movies that you can't help but watch it for what it SHOULD'VE been, rather than what it is. It rates a 6.0/10 on the ""B"" scale. That's a 4.2/10 (on the ""A"" scale) for having a good plot, from... the Fiend :."

2387,"very bad movie - a laugh-less black comedy; I'm perfectly capable of enjoying black comedies and gallows humor, and I don't require that the characters in movies be saints. However, I don't remember laughing at this movie even once. I'd even considered leaving the theater when I saw it. Unfortunately, I'm at a loss to explain why it misfired for me. I like many of the actors; some of them are very good actors, in fact, just not here. The cinematography was good. Kobe Tai, who I'd never seen before, brought a lot of energy to her scene and I wish they'd had more of her. I guess for me the flaw was in the writing, or that this movie simply wasn't for me. I confess I'm puzzled as to what people found humorous in this movie."
152429,"Disappointing thriller; Director Val Guest's DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE ranks among the great British science fiction films that doubles as one of the best newspaper films as well. A cautionary tale which expertly tapped into the A-bomb jitters of the early sixties, the film centers on the aftermath of a nuclear upheaval which sends the world on a crash course towards the sun. The hook of the film is that the action is seen through the eyes of journalists who chart the story and eventually arrive at the truth despite the web of official government lies and deceit. 80,000 SUSPECTS, released only two years later, is something of a companion piece, once again centering on a group of professional people struggling to balance their personal lives as the world is falling apart around them, in this case it's a smaller-scale disaster in the form of an outbreak of smallpox. Guest uses the exact same technique: gritty black and white photography and ample use of authentic locations and hand-held camera conveying a newsreel look. With everything in place for a sizzling apocalyptic thriller, it's a pity 800,000 SUSPECTS wastes it all on the director's own turgid and profoundly tedious script. The cast of lovable cynics spouting razor-sharp dialog in DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE is sorely missed. Instead, the characters are so akin to a Hollywood hospital soap opera a la THE INTERNS, I half-expected to see Michael Callan lurching around in his white scrubs. As the married doctor-and-nurse team who tackle the epidemic head-on, Richard Johnson and Claire Bloom are never less than professional but never more than marginally interesting (the pair would shortly reunite as the leads in Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING). More disappointingly is that Mr. Guest uses the opportunity to give a plum role to his wife, the talented Yolande Donlan who several years earlier became the toast of London's West End recreating Judy Holliday's role in BORN YESTERDAY. Unfortunately, her big scene playing drunken wife of a staff physician is overlong, over-written and serves to slow the film down even before it has a chance to begin. It's not surprising that this film has dropped into obscurity."
6157,"director's cut- do yourself a favor. See it; First of all, i was never a reader of the comics, and didn't know much about daredevil before venturing into the cinemas to see the original when it was released. At the time, there wasn't much action out and i like most of Ben Affleck's movies, so though i would give it a go. Although i liked the theatrical release ( but didn't love it) i still bought it when it came to DVD...and to be honest, when i watched it the 2nd time on DVD, i didn't think as much of it, as when i left the cinema. So when i heard the directors cut was out, and people who hated the first release, but liked the 2nd one, i thought wow, i didn't mind the first, perhaps i will really like the new version. and guess what? I did ! Its absolutely fantastic. After the characters were fleshed out more, the storyline was more involved and filled in the plots- you actually cared about what happened and got more into the feel of being apart of what was going on in hell's kitchen. If you watch the ""featurette"" : giving the devil his dues, you will understand that Mark Johnson the director, absolutely loves this material, loved the comic, and was disappointed himself with the theatrical release. He understood why the critics & fans alike didn't support it, and really wanted to fix the problems with this DVD. When will Hollywood studios & executives learn, a 100 minute movie, does not mean a better movie - and when will they learn that audiences DO want more than just action - we can think, you morons! And can hold our attention for more than 100 minutes. Here's a simple plan for your money making schemes - and this goes to Gary Foster ( producer who still says the theatrical version of daredevil is better) If you make a GOOD MOVIE, that gets good reviews, and that fans & critics enjoy, then more people will see it, more people will see it a 2nd time, more people will recommend it to friends, and that means a bigger audience, a repeat audience and bigger dollars for your pockets ! So while the first was a quick paced movie that made quick bucks, a longer - more thought-out MOVIE, would have garnered longer life at the box office. in a word - RECOMMENDED !"
31694,"An insult to Austen and intelligence!; After watching and enjoying ""Bend It Like Beckham"", I was really looking forward to Gurinder Chadha's new film ""Bride and Prejudice"". However ten minutes into the movie I just could not believe that the same woman actually helped create this terrible, terrible movie!! It attempts to re-tell ""Pride and Prejudice"" with a Bollywood twist, however I think all Jane Austen and Bollywood movie fans would just be insulted by this garbage. Aishwarya Rai plays Lalitha Bhakshi(the equivalent to Elizabeth Bennett) and she proved to me that she can't act in 2 different languages. The character was lame and did not develop at all. Martin Henderson plays Will Darcy (the equivalent to Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy) he does a good job, its just a shame he had to act opposite to Rai. The only other 2 actors I liked were Anupam Kher (Mr Bhakshi/Mr Bennett) and Alexis Bledel (Georgie/Georgianna) who weren't used as much as they should have been. The songs were ridiculous and the voice over for Aishwarya Rai throughout her songs was terrible, I really hope Gurinder re-thinks making a movie like this ever again or for that matter casting Rai. 1/10 (the one is giving credit to Martin Henderson, Anupam Kher and Alexis Bledel)"
30894,"Mostly static; The deceased are contacting us through radio and TV waves. Some believe it and study it, others dismiss it as hoax. Wherever you stand on this phenomena, you cannot deny that it is a creepy concept and could make for creepy movie. Unfortunately ""White Noise"" is not that movie. I wanted to like this movie and after seeing the terrifying trailer I thought there was a chance it would be good. Here's yet another example where the trailer makes the film look better than it is. It all faults in the story and logic. When I say logic, I don't mean the concept of the story. Whether EVP exists or not, I can believe it does for the sake of the film. The script tries to rush past the obligatory ""showing the life of the main character before the tragic event"" part. Usually I would not mind, but it is done so blandly and clichéd that it doesn't serve its purpose to create a believable character. Jonathan's (KEATON) reactions to what is happening do not seem real and are used to give way to his other actions. The script decides to forgo the skepticism that most people inexperienced with the supernatural would feel when introduced to something like this. Jonathan hears a voice on the computer and proceeds to set-up his own fancy ghost recording center. He doesn't even question what it is he's listening to. The concept of EVP also takes a very disappointing turn when we find out who the 'ghosts' really are. The movie has some tense moments, but they are few and predictable. The kind that are accompanied by silence and then a sudden jolt in noise while something happens on screen. This movie had a great opportunity to deliver some real scares and failed on the grand scale. Most disappointing was the lame and preposterous ending. I'll save the revelation for the discussion boards, but it seemed that the script writers did not know how to finish the film and came up with the easiest thing possible...in the same fashion ""The Forgotten"" (2004) did. All in all a lame take on something that is really scary. Had this movie been done correctly it could have sparked a fear of the radios and TV's we love, cause whether you believe in the concept or not, the notion of it is unsettling. On the other hand, WHITE NOISE rates a 3/10."
30894,"NOT Scary, BAD Acting, Snooze Fest!!; Bad, bad, bad! If this movie scares you, you obviously only watch G rated Disney movies. It was awful and really not even that interesting. Poor plot, poor effects, poor ME for having spent my time watching it! Michael Keaton's idea of acting seems to be squinting his eyes and holding his mouth open for long periods of time. This phenomenon called EVP could have and should have made for an interesting movie... surprise, it DIDN'T! The only redeeming thing about this film is that I saw it at the famous Mann's Chinese in Hollywood. Other than that, P-U, it stunk! Wait for video, if you watch it at all...."
2613,"A forgotten gem from the 80's; There's a lot worth forgetting about the 80's but one of the few things that decade of big hair and keyboard-drowned-music had was some of the best horror and sci-fi comedies of any time. There have been funny scary movies before and scary funny movies since, but some of the best examples of those perfectly balanced action, horror, and science fiction comedies were made in the 80's. I'm thinking of other good ones like Fright Night, American Werewolf in London, Big Trouble in Little China and on maybe a level or two below films like Return of The Living Dead and Toxic Avenger. Some people use the term spoof when referring to a lot of these movies but that's the wrong word in my opinion. Naked Gun and Airplane were spoofs, movies like Night of the Comet and Fright Night were genuine horror films that had a nice mixture of scares, drama, and tongue-in-cheek laughs. All of these elements of different genres are what made these movies unique. While classic might be a little too strong of a word to describe Night of the Comet, I agree with most other folks here that it is a great low-budget 80's movie (maybe not low-budget, but definitely not big-budget). There was a vast amount of post-apocalyptic, low-budget horror films in the 80's but this is one that stands apart due to writer-director Thom Eberhardt's sharp, don't-take-it-all-too-seriously slant. Just the idea alone of two valley girls being among the small group of survivors of a world ending disaster is pretty cool. It took a familiar science fiction idea and made it somewhat original. But more importantly it was perfect for the times. Take Dawn of the Dead, mix in Valley Girl and Fast Times at Ridgemont High and you've got an excellent foundation for scares, action, drama and of course laughs. The acting all around is very good for this type of flick and while it certainly isn't perfect, the entertaining and fun spirit of the movie make up for any flaws. It also can't be said enough that the presence of Catherine Mary Stewart definitely helps to elevate the movie. She was one of the most beautiful and under-appreciated actresses of the 80's and despite being in a few bigger movies and shows (The Last Starfighter, Nighthawks, Mischief, Weekend at Bernie's, Days of Our Lives, etc...), she just never really became the household name she seemed destined to be. Although no doubt she has plenty of fans like me. Unlike many lead actresses of the day in this genre, she was actually a very capable actress. Both she and Kelli Maroney give knock-out performances as two teenage girls just trying to cope with brain-eating zombies and the end of the world. If curiosity about this movie has led you here, then I would pay little attention to the few negative reviews and trust the fact that the large majority of comments here are positive about this film. Maybe Night of the Comet isn't a forgotten ""classic"" by the normal standards, but it was certainly a cut above the typical low-budget horror/post-apocalyptic movies of the 80's and deserves to be seen by many. What it doesn't deserve is its current state of obscurity, its too-low rating on IMDb, and to not be available on DVD. That's the real shame of it all."
903,"Alfred Hitchcock at his best; this is one of the best movies i've seen and I'm only 15 years old. i first saw this movie in a high school film class I'm taking and i fell in love with it. the story itself was a great idea and the settings and acting was so believable. it was also good because in the 50's they didn't make movies like this with the screen changing colors and all that good stuff. the actors chosen for this movie were all great choices because they did the movie excellently and it gave the movie that mysterious spooky feeling. the ending gave the movie a whole new twist and i was not expecting it at all. this is one of my favorite movies and if you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're missing out on."
8861,"Don't waste your time, or your money.; If you enjoyed the game's series of resident evil, don't waste your time on this title as it has nothing to do with the actual game except the fact that the Umbrella corp is in there, along with a few of its creatures. the ""REAL"" main character(Jill Valentine) gets tossed aside. there seems to be A lot of fluff and a lot of camp in this movie. Just someone's idea to make money off of a otherwise decent game title, which CAPCOM should have never let happen. I watched the first movie with disappointment, and figured the sequel would get to the main story that is RESIDENT EVIL. after sitting through the second title i was in disbelief. people who do not play these games should never be allowed to make movie titles based on them. its insulting at best."
5995,"Beautiful; When I watched the Oscar telecast in 2003, I was rooting for 'Chicago' to win the Best Picture nod. When it did I was elated, for I too was caught up in the 'Razzle Dazzle'. Then I watched 'The Pianist' and the movie just blew me away. I loved the subtle things, his day to day survival, even how the colour slowly drained from the screen until we were just left with muted grays. The scene in which the tank rolls down the street and matter-of-factly begins to shoot at passersby is delicately and simply executed. No blood, no special effects, no music, just a running lady stopped in mid-stride and slumped in the road. It really brought home to me that this was NOT just a movie, and it never sets out to be just a movie. It is truly a re-telling of the truth of Spilman's life. Brody truly shines in this role; he is neither too bland or too over-dramatic. It is truly difficult to carry a picture by oneself and remain compelling throughout. Polanski and the entire cast and crew truly deserved the Best Picture Oscar for 2003, and I am at least grateful that I had also rooted for Brody to take home the Best Actor statue."
8984,"Like a guy who only has 4 fingers on each hand...... 2 thumbs down!!!!!!; Oceans 12 has plenty going for it. All of the original cast have returned, the original director has returned and they put themselves up against one crafty criminal to contend with. Sounds good? Well I can tell you that this was so bad it was insulting to my intelligence. Boring, long and pointless and a really really disappointing ending, I felt like going to the counter and asking for my money back. It was probably the lamest sequel since The Whole 10 Yards (which also stank). As a matter of fact I spent a few days with some homeless people afterwards in a bid to try and overpower the smell it had left upon me to no avail. When I think of how bad this was I recall the noise that was played during a wrong guess on Family Feud Bu-Bowwwwww."
26479,"Gilbert and Sullivan still have a strong and legitimate appeal; History records that Gilbert and Sullivan were personally often at odds when producing their great comic operettas - no doubt that, if they are still monitoring this, they are surprised to find both their humour and their music - despite its limitations in both time and location - still has a great appeal to audiences throughout much of the world. The music of course is timeless, but music too evolves and many people today have no appreciation of the types of lyrics which G & S exploited so shamelessly. Perhaps the remarkable thing is the wide and continuing appeal of so many of their works. This film is a movie version of a 100th anniversary Broadway stage production of this operetta in New York. A review of previous comments show, not unexpectedly, that it has been adored by numerous G. & S. fans; but that its appeal to those who are not in this category is much more limited. They also make it clear that this is a very fine production; and it would be a serious omission if I did not re-emphasise it is almost a classical example of the way in which a major stage production should be presented on film, both to retain the best of the original production and to as fully as possible exploit the more fluid form of presentation that is possible on the screen. To your reviewer who reports fears about wearing out her taped version, I would recommend doing what I have done and converting this to a VCD disk that she can play, almost for ever, on her DVD player. It is, I believe, a great film; and my wife and I have also viewed it repeatedly whenever we have been a little ""blue"", we never fail to feel cheered up afterwards. However we recognise that most members of the contemporary generation would not respond in this way, and that our appreciation will not even be understood by them. We remain thankful that minority tastes can still be satisfied without infringing on the perogatives of the majority, and that in the process of doing so the film will be seen by many who initially have little sympathy with the production, but who find that - as with so many of us in the older generation - they have come to appreciate both its music and its humour."
25834,"they just don't make them like this anymore...; this has to be one of my favorite films ever. I loved it as a kid and the last time I happened to catch it on TV, i loved it just as much and cried just as hard. Freddy Bartholomew! what a fantastic little actor this kid was! and of course, the unparalleled Spencer Tracy as Manuel the fisherman we all love so much, is simply fantastic. i did not realize that this was a Fleming film, that explains a lot. All of my favorites from this era seem to have had this man at the wheel. He sure knew the right combination of sentiment, humor, melodrama, and reality to come up with a winner most of the time. I'm glad to see so many other votes and comments that echo (i guess i'm the echo tho, huh?) my own feelings about this film Its nice to know others also feel as strongly and as warmly about it as i always have. it sure deserves it. I sing ""Yo, ho little fish, don't cry, don't cry, Yo ho little fish don't cry, don't cry"" to my kids at night thanks to Manuel. It always works too!"
8783,"Seven layers of the candy cane forest; Why would anybody in there right mind send their blind daughter on a journey through a woods to find medicine in a town that she knows nothing about when obviously he could have done it in half the time with know problems at all. I know he made a promise not to leave but honestly would you send your blind daughter instead. I mean he already broke one promise by telling her that everything was fake. It would have made the movie really dull, but if there was know way to resolve this story without being ridiculous or really dull then maybe the story shouldn't have been made in the first place. Also the arguments about why she would be scared in the woods is so stupid. januaryman-2 posts ""HER FATHER TOLD HER THAT THEY MADE UP THE CREATURES BUT THAT THERE WERE RUMORS OF SUCH CREATURES IN THE HISTORY BOOKS HE USED TO TEACH"" Are you serious! You don't find that absolutely ridiculous in the first place? Why would a professor of history believe in scary monsters in the woods? Which leads me back to my first point. Why did he think it was alright for his blind daughter to go to town through the seven layers of the candy cane forest with scary monsters!"

8957,"This movie was absolute crap on a stick.; Well, to be honest I have seen worse movies.....but not many. I was ""fortunate"" enough to see this movie at it's Las Vegas sneak peek a week before it opened. Needless to say I did my best to forget it, but after seeing a sign for ""Saw"" at the local dollar-movie-theater my friends and I began to joke with my friends in the car about the wretchedness that simply was this film. An interesting concept, at first glance, but in retrospect there are a lot of films about serial killers that a far better than this and the only thing that is interesting about the idea is that this murderer is just a little more artsy and creative. Once you get past the acting of Leigh Whannell the first five minutes minutes aren't bad, but then it's all down hill from there. From the cheap hypertension/pop out scares to the cookie cutter chase scenes, this movie blows.......hard. Typically I enjoy Danny Glover and he has given many worthwhile performances. He was definitely the best part of this film, but he was phoning the whole thing in......logically that can tell you what the rest of the movie was like. Whannell is completely awful throughout and made my nuts hurt, just watching him attempt to act. Typically when someone hears you make such a critique they say, ""Oh yeah, like you could do better?"" Well, in this case I would have to say, ""Yes."" Cary Elwes, who I also typically love, is so bad in the last scene of the film that I began to question whether or not it was SUPPOSED to be funny. The acting was certainly as bad as the directing and script. If I do have one good thing to say about this steaming pile of monkey shirt, it's that all parts are equally terrible. How anyone could put this movie in the same class as Se7en or any of the Carpenter, Craven, Hooper, and Barker films is beyond be. This film is pure excrement. When this comes out on DVD (which will probably be in a month) save the two hrs it takes to watch and teach a k under privileged kid how to read. Save the twenty bucks and give it to a homeless guy, cause him buying a bottle of vodka with it is better spent than buying this movie."
8368,"The best so far...; Not only does ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" manage to shed most of the syrupy ""kid-stuff"" atmosphere of its predecessors, it comes amazingly close to the status of a true fantasy classic. Fresh, original and creative, this film is visually and subtextually unpredictable; the change of directors stands out like a breath of fresh air. Even the musical score is a major improvement. This is saying a lot... I enjoyed the first two movies, in particular the second. This one I enjoyed on a much different and 'higher' level. It is in fact ""darker"" than the first two as often claimed, but still quite appropriate for kids. What really makes this one different is that it's appropriate for adults as well... parents, go see and enjoy this one with your kids. 9/10"
7361,"An excellent film; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet is a story of lessons learned. Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) have a very unique yet dysfunctional relationship that ends with Clementine deciding to completely erase Joel from her memory. When Joel learns what she has done, he in turn decides to erase Clementine. In the middle of the procedure, Joel revisits memories of happiness, memories of love. Although he was hurt by Clementine, he can not bear thought of losing those special memories, and does everything he can to hold on to the little he has left. Many viewers confused this movie with an average boy/girl love story, a chick flick with that ""feel-good"" ending, but that is not what this movie is about. This story teaches us to learn from our mistakes, and that wisdom is derived from good AND bad experiences. A broken heart can make someone stronger, pain teaches us mercy, suffering teaches compassion. People who can accept their scars, are the wisest of us all. Joel and Clementine are perfect examples of the fool that forgets what life has taught him and is forced to re-live his most careless mistakes over and over again. Everyone who commented on this movie as being anything less than fantastic had no right to go see it in the first place. It would be nice if you let the intelligent people enjoy this without having to endure your idiotic ramblings about ""oooh i don't understand.."" Stick to Scooby Doo, you'll be much happier. I highly recommend this movie. Lindsay"
6827,"Awesome Movie!; I personally thought this movie was very exhilarating. I had never seen the skit on SNL, but I found Pat to be inspiring. I'm also a trans gendered person, and it has been very difficult for me to deal with people's reactions to my surgery (I went from female to male). I used to be teased and abused excessively as a young girl, and getting a penis has been the best decision of my life. Throughout the movie, Pat had the self-confidence of a panther and the the street-smarts of an alley cat, and I just wish I could have had those qualities when I was younger. I had to go through anesthesia to get even half the confidence that he, well, ""IT"", has. This is really an excellent film. Two thumbs up."
4789,"i love this movie...; so much. i wish i could watch it right now. ""life at last! salutations from the other side""...used to have the soundtrack but lost it somewhere and have missed it ever since. Brian de palma - he is always the one that makes these films that get under your skin. i will always wonder why this film didn't garner more of a following. it sure should have. i love the songs, the score and the characters are fantastic. especially ""Beef,"" just hilarious. And it really does have moments where its a bit scary. I mean not really but you know, kinda gets your heart going a bit. Paul Williams best effort in front of a camera definitely. Tho the scenes with him and Jessica are a bit forced to say the least but hey - Paul deserves some TLC too right?. Right! And of course there is that underlying ""poetic justice"" theme a la Phantom of the Opera that is undeniably wicked but welcomed. We want the revenge to happen. if you have never seen this movie - i don't know what to tell you except u missed a good one!"
3052,"Dogmatic but highly amusing; This work is a very unorthodox and irreverent look at (mainly) catholicism, and other forms of organized religion. Absolutely hilarious, if you have a jaded sense of humor. Frankly, I love this movie! It plays well, even, and intelligently clever throughout. Alan Rickman's performance as the Metatron is most excellent; ironic, dark, and dryly witty. Matt Damon rocks as Loki, and even Ben Affleck contributes a decent characterization. In my opinion, Dogma doesn't deserve the low rating it's received here at IMDb, but that rating does reflect the opinions of a Christian-dominated society. I'm frankly a bit surprised it rates two tenths of a point higher in the US than it does in other countries. Pleasantly surprised. In a society dominated by organized religion, I found this to be a great 90 or so minutes' diversion. True, unadulterated entertainment. It rates a solid 7.6/10 from... the Fiend :."
3275,"Don't Waste Your Time!; This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies of all time! I have no idea how ""Boondock Saints"" ever got produced, but it makes me believe that getting a film made in this country isn't about talent, or a good script, or decent acting or directing, but rather, who you meet or know. It blows my mind that there is actually the possibility of a sequel being produced!! If I was stuck on a desert island with only this movie and nothing else to do, I would go drown myself! After you watch the first five minutes of this ""movie,"" trust your instincts that tell you to stop what you're doing and go do anything else! You don't have to know much about movies or have much taste to realize that a five-year-old could do a better job with a home camera. I can't imagine how or why so many people could rate this well on IMDb, but it makes me reluctant to ever trust these ratings again."
30707,"Question about the final shot.......; When the camera started to zoom in on the diner, I figured it meant that Frankie had bought it. But, at least to me, when I looked through the window it looked like Maggie's MOTHER at the counter waitressing. I'm sure this isn't what I was seeing! I plan to go see this again at some point, but this was bugging me. Where was Frankie in this shot-sitting at the counter? And who was that standing behind the counter?? And why is it a minimum TEN lines of text are required to post something? I have nothing more to say so I just have to babble and babble and babble until I take up ten lines of text. I think IMDb.com needs to re-think this rule. I've never heard anything so lame...."
8947,"The potential is wasted.; During The Grudge, you hoped that maybe the movie would mix Lost in Translation with The Ring and a couple of fresh scares. Instead, the movie sucked on all fours. The fresh scares you would expect from a modern horror movie were replaced with the same generic garbage we've been force-fed since our youth. Which is sad really, because the idea of The Grudge originally had the potential to be a very good movie. Seriously, please give this movie fifteen minutes and you can see how they blew it. When Bill Pullman opens the movie, you wish later on that you joined him. Strange things are amuck in a house in Japan that forgives neither American nor Japanese. Was there some point where you had no clue what was going on? Minutes are spent looking at scenery and rooms. There's a dim hue that becomes annoying. And sadly, there are the obligatory references to a more famous film based on yet another Japanese film, The Ring with: ghastly women, photos that intrigue and, eyes, oh no, eyes! I would encourage anyone to watch this movie if they want a headache. It's safe to say for now that it cannot get any worse than this second rate rip-off of any true horror movie you might have wanted to see."
8959,"A psychological character study; The plot is probably generally heard by regular movie goers who have not even seen the movie: Anna (Nicole Kidman), 10 years after losing husband Sean and shortly after she has finally given in to a marriage proposal, is approached by a 10 year boy (Cameron Bright) by the same name claiming to be her husband reincarnated. At the opening scene, we see how Sean (but not his face) collapsing during jogging in Central Park in winter. We have seen Central Park in so many different lights in so many different movies, but never looking so ominous as in this one. Even more overwhelming is the score, starting in pulsating strings, intercepted sporadically by bright sounding brass, but culminating in a fatalistic crescendo of timpani as Sean collapses. Although the movie has suspenseful supernatural overtone and there is a twist (albeit a mild one), do not expect it to be anything like ""Sixth Sense."" Rather than focusing on whether the boy Sean really is or is not Sean reincarnated, one can get more out of the film by trying to empathize with Anna. Not to be missed is of course the so much talked-about Kidman's 2-minute close up shot giving us a peep through the expression on her face what's going on in her mind. There's no question that it's a tremendous challenge, but she is helped a little by having the scene set in an opera performance, where the music punctuates her thoughts. Just imagine the same scene but with her sitting quietly by herself, with no background music or even sound  how much more difficult that would be. Kidman masterfully portrays the various psychological states of Anna, first the indignation at the cruel prank from a 10-year-old, then the gradual acceptance of the weird story, starting with the scene in the opera mentioned. Acceptance becomes absolute conviction as she defends Sean against incredulous relatives and friends  watch for that creepy expression on her face when she says, ""yes he is"". Then, she faces the devastating shattering of her dream in a bathtub scene (NOT the also much talked-about scene when they are BOTH in a bath, but the one when Sean is bathing by himself), ""you're just a little boy"", she says in a bitter laugh. Losing her husband once is tragic enough. Losing him twice is something from which she may never be able to recover, as hinted in the final, wedding scene. But the most tragic thing is not known even to Anna herself, but only to the audience, who must leave the cinema heart broken but also praying that Anna may never find out what the husband she loves so much is really like."
30820,"Kevin Bacon stands tall in The Woodsman; A disturbing past and an uncertain present and future are what torment a former convict in The Woodsman. An intense study in guilt, misunderstanding, and hope, it is not an easy film to watch casually. Suggested by the old children's story of Little Red Riding Hood in which the woodsman saves the girl from a wolf, the film is actually adapted from a stage play by first-time director Nicole Kassell and screenwriter Steven Fechter. Walter is a just-released prison inmate who has spent a decade behind bars for molesting young girls. He starts a new job at a construction supply company where he meets a tough yet pretty woman, Vickie (Kyra Sedgwick). Their relationship develops even as the past haunts Walter. The police are waiting for his next move, and coworkers spread damning information. His younger sister will have nothing to do with him and his brother-in-law (Benjamin Bratt) is one of the only persons from his past who will talk to him. He wonders if he will revert to his old pedophilia ways as he sees children nearby in playgrounds, on buses, or in the park. It certainly 'takes one to know one' when his past merges with the present to reveal that he is not the only predator in the neighborhood. And there is a fateful meeting with a schoolgirl one day that will change everything. Will he find happiness even though he has done horrible wrongs in the past? Can he be redeemed? Will he fall back into his criminal behavior? Certainly many films in recent years have incorporated sexually aberrant themes such as pedophilia into their story lines but very few have done so as the main plot unto itself. There have been few films in cinema history to deal with such an inflammatory subject. Fritz Lang's M was a notable exception from the early 1930's and it stands as a landmark in many ways. Stanley Kubrick's Lolita in 1962 touched on the subject and so did its remake decades later. Perhaps The Woodsman's most obvious progenitor was Guy Green's The Mark from 1961 with an impressive performance by Stuart Whitman as a similarly tormented man. The Woodsman is a small, independent film that belies its theatrical origins and low budget with unattractive sets, plain clothing, and starkly lit cinematography. It is the performances here that count. Kevin Bacon, who has been in a wide range of large and small roles (Footloose, Diner, Tremors, Apollo 13, Sleepers), gives perhaps his most daring performance. (It echoes Tim Robbin's character in Mystic River, ironically a recent Bacon film as well.) You look at his expression of hurt and guilt, and that says quite a bit. We know he has done awful things yet we want redemption for his lost soul. We become complicit in his conflict. Bacon's portrayal is deserving of an Oscar nomination in any year much less in 2004, which has had some of the best male lead performances on record. Kyra Sedgwick (Bacon's real-life wife) scores impressively as a coworker who tries to connect with Bacon's character, and who has some secrets of her own. The rest of the cast is strong including rapper Mos Def as a detective who is shadowing Bacon in hopes of catching him at his old tricks. Hannah Pilkes rates special note as a pivotal, potential victim, Robin. Hers is a small role that gives the film poignancy and pathos. Her scenes with Walter are what elevate the film to a new level and perspective. There are a few drawbacks with the film. One wishes that Sedgwick's Vickie was explored more in relation to Walter. What starts out as a good character study of Vickie and how she starts to understand and help him is a crucial element to the film and is never expanded fully. The film does plod methodically in its narrative and really doesn't pick up steam until past the half way point during a fateful meeting between Walter and his new friend, Robin. There are recurring scenes with Walter and his therapist which shed some insight into his youth, and it would have been nice to develop the psychotherapy especially at the end instead of dropping it at a crucial juncture. It is to the filmmakers' credit that nothing of molestation is actually depicted but plenty is suggested and acknowledged. The Woodsman had trouble getting distribution due to its controversial subject matter. Luckily, it is now getting wider release and recognition for tackling its story with earnest feeling and conviction. At less than 90 minutes, it is a relatively short movie. It is not for everyone, but those looking for an honest, unflinching study of individual guilt and salvation, will appreciate some gut wrenching performances in a small, deserving film. ***1/2 of **** especially for Kevin Bacon"
2340,"Reflective And Philosophical; For a long time I put off watching this, because I have no interest in superficial, teen comedy flicks, as implied by the film's pedestrian title and by the casting of a youthful Brad Pitt. But ""Meet Joe Black"" is anything but ""superficial"", and ""teen comedy"" does not describe this movie at all. Set in contemporary New York, the film follows a wealthy family whose patriarchal sixty-five year old head, played by Anthony Hopkins, is nearing the end of his life. Enter ""Joe Black"" (Brad Pitt), a handsome, but enigmatic, young man with an unusual agenda. This is a thought-provoking movie about mortality and emotional separation. It will appeal to viewers with a reflective and philosophical nature. But the film also has humor, which keeps it from being grim. The pace is slow. There's lots of silence and stillness, entirely appropriate, given the subject matter. Among other things, the film presents the novel idea that a supernatural being can be subject to human emotions, and can make mistakes in judgment resulting from those emotions. The film is not perfect. The plot is a tad egocentric. There's no reference to the universality and ongoing occurrence of death outside the confines of this family. Also, why now? Why does death choose to engage life in our present world, why not five hundred years ago? Minor script changes could have addressed these issues. The initial meeting between Susan (Claire Forlani) and Joe Black seems a little too convenient, but forms the basis for a plot twist that strengthens the overall story. The acting is excellent. Anthony Hopkins is, as usual, outstanding. I would not have cast Brad Pitt in the role he plays, but he does a good job. Appropriate for this movie, the acting style for both Pitt and Forlani is one wherein they communicate their characters to viewers largely by means of their eyes, which, as taught by ancient philosophers, are the windows of the soul. For viewers who liked ""The Sixth Sense"", another serious film with depth of meaning, I recommend ""Meet Joe Black"" most highly."
30816,"Stole my heart right out of my freaking chest.; I went into the theater knowing only this: It was an opera, it had a Phantom, a chandelier falls. That's about it. I'd heard parts of some of the songs from a friend of mine who had the soundtrack. The moment it went from black and white to color and organs, I literally got about three or four waves of chills through me. From then on it was total beauty. -Begin rant- Someone claiming to be a professional opera singer said that all the voices sucked except Minnie Driver's character. Ahem: HER VOICE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ANNOYING. Did you not notice the cleaning ladies stuffing cotton in their ears when she sang? Geez, people are stupid. -End rant- I was totally swept up into every aspect. But when the Phantom leads her down the corridor to his lair, I just about died. I wasn't expecting him to be so downright beautiful and enticing. But his clothes and his emotion and his voice...and the CAPE. Totally blown away. Now, this was NOT a perfect film. Some of the singing didn't synch up to the actors, and in my opinion, everyone (except Phantom) could have acted just a tad more passionate when they were singing, even though some of it was supposed to be a substitute for speaking. Gerard Butler really stole the show as the Phantom. By the end you feel so bad for him it makes you cry. Bravo, everyone involved with film. With just a tad bit of tweaking, it could have been perfect, and it pains me to give this film a 9.5 out of 10 'cause it swept me away so intensely. Favorite songs were Phantom of the Opera and Point of No Return (my heart was pounding so hard during the latter I thought I'd stand up and attack the screen.)"
74099,"Guess who the figurative ""hero"" of this western is?; It is 1864 and the Civil War entered it's crisis period. The North and South were locked into a war to the finish. In the summer of 1864 Grant changed his strategy, releasing Phil Sheridan into the Shenandoah Valley. Suddenly the South was having problems getting food for Lee's army. Furthermore Lee lacked new arms to replace those lost or used up after three years of war. Nevada had only entered the Union in 1864. It's second largest city (Virginia City) had a sizable number of southern born citizens. They contacted the Confederate government with a scheme to steal a fortune, transport it to Mexico, take it to Europe to buy modern arms to be taken to save Lee's army. It was a brilliant scheme so it was approved. However, a Northern spy learned of the scheme, and an agent went to Virginia City. He was able to prevent the scheme from succeeding. In the film Flynn is a prisoner in Libby Prison in Richmond, which is run by Randolph Scott. Before he escapes he learns of the Virginia City scheme. So he is sent with his two pals (Hale and Williams), to prevent the scheme from happening. On the way west they meet John Murrell, a ""half-breed"" badman (he tries to arrange the robbery of their stagecoach, only to find himself outwitted by Flynn). Murrell is played by Humphrey Bogart. Scott's contact person with the Virginian Southerners (led by Moroni Olsen and John Litel) is Miriam Hopkins, a dance hall singer. She is Scott's girlfriend. But as soon as Flynn shows up and discovers Hopkins, he starts getting into her way as much as possible. Soon, although her patriotic heart is with gallant Scott, she finds she likes the rakish Flynn too. In the meantime, as he realizes what the scheme's time-schedule is he tries to prod more action from the local Northern military commander. But this fellow just laughs it off. The Southerners manage to break out making the Union commander realize he was too complacent. Soon northern troops led by him and Flynn are in pursuit. Flynn, Hale, and Williams (after an argument with the commander) go south. Soon they find proof that Scott and his party have gone that way, but that they are being followed by Bogart and his gang. In the end there is a fight, and Flynn and Scott join forces. Bogart is killed, but Scott is fatally shot. He manages to make a personal peace with Flynn at the end. Now in charge of the silver Flynn decides the silver could be useful to help rebuild the South after the war. So he hides the silver, and then heads back with the survivors. When he faces the Union commander Flynn won't reveal where the silver is. He is arrested for treason, subsequently found guilty and sentenced to death. Hopkins heads to Washington, and sees Abe Lincoln (Victor Killian) at the last moment (a calendar says it is April 14, 1865). Flynn is pardoned, and presumably will get the silver to the South - and will be joined to Hopkins. Twisted loyalties here? In the Hollywood of the ""Golden Age"" the market in the southern states was not going to be threatened by the realities of the war - nothing about slavery in this film. So good guys Flynn and Scott, although foes in warfare are decent types who would have been good friends without the war. Now the two problems. The performance of Bogart, despite his determination to be animated, is wooden. He was out of place in westerns set in the old west. He could fit into the modern west of his period, and gave first rate performances in THE PETRIFIED FOREST, HIGH SIERRA, and(best of all) is THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRES. Here Bogart is doing his best but his heart can't be in it. The villainy is too exotic for him. It's also, apparently, a lie. John Murrell was a figure of some note in the Mississippi Valley of the 1830s, known as the great land pirate. He had (supposedly) a large gang of desperadoes, involved in slave stealing, slave trading, robbery and murder, and supposedly had plans to lead a large slave revolt in 1835 to seize three or four states. He was betrayed, and sent to prison for a number of years. He was not involved with a gang in Nevada and the southwest United States in 1864! Now the second problem: who is the figurative ""hero"" of the film? Well Scott and Flynn are the two heroes to the viewers (Scott the gallant foe martyr; Flynn the decent sort who wants to help those poor souls rebuild their world after the war ends). But in terms of the law and reality, it is the commander of the northern troops in Nevada, despite his being too sanguine and complacent at first, who is the real hero. So our military commander is the figurative ""hero"" of this western, because he did the right thing legally! Who is he? Well, in a film headed with Errol Flynn, Randolph Scott, and Humphrey Bogart, the actual hero is none other than DOUGLAS DUMBRILLE."
8968,"Well acted entertaining thriller without style; This is a somewhat entertaining cat and mouse thriller with Brosnan, Hayek and Harrelson at the top of their game. The film starts out promisingly enough with a diamond heist which is more slapstick than suspenseful. After the heist Harrelson follows the pair to an island where he believes they plan another big job. As the two male characters get more closely acquainted throughout the film we start to wonder who's tricking who. Brosnan displays rare emotion in this film. Harrelson escapes his Cheers role by excellently portraying the many sides of what would have been a simple character.Hayek doesn't miss a chance to show off her body, and Don Cheadle's villain was superb. The only problem with that character was that we didn't see enough of him. The film has some nice scenery and entertaining scenes, particularly the shark capture.Rush hour director Ratner has made a great film, which only really lacks style and good pacing. this film would have been better handled in the reins of, say, Steven Soderbergh. But nonetheless, a very funny enjoyable film which will please fans of the cast and crew, as well as the movie-going public. It's not up to the standard of Oceans's eleven yet it beats the likes of Ocean's 12. Any fan of the comedy/thriller genre should go see this film, but I will be looking more forward to Rush Hour 3."
31221,"People!; What you people don't seem to understand is that people want to go see a movie they'd like. It doesn't matter what some weird person I've never met, in a foreign country, who has different preferences to me says about it, I'll see what I want to see. If all you've got to do in your life is going around, spreading your worthless opinions, about people and movies that other people love and admire, than you are sadder than you claim the movies you've seen are. So Please, if you have no reasonable opinion, one that clearly matters, even in some small way, besides the ones that are disrespectful and pointlessly obscured, don't post it! I know if I want to see a movie, I'll see it, even if some low idiot on the internet says its crap or not!"
8973,"Dishonest Noir; All the great noir films have one thing in common: no matter how manipulative they are with audience expectations, they play fair and ultimately the story, no matter how many twists and turns it takes, makes some kind of sense. By having Bernal play Ignacio in the story ""The Visit"", and then another actor play him in the truthful telling of his story, the audience is thrown a curve from which the film never recovers. Was is budgetary reasons or just intellectual laziness that led the director to insert another actor as Ignacio at the end of the film? Bernal could easily have played both Ignacio and Juan during those last scenes. By that time, the endless, increasingly unbelievable plot developments, and the revelation that the brother of Ignacio is the murderer have undermined any integrity the film might have had. This film is not up to dealing with the serious issue of priests molesting children. It is much more interested in exhibiting the director's personal obsessions than in crafting a truly involving and meaningful screen story. Yes Hitchcock worked out his obsessions in his films. But he also had the talent and craft to integrate them in stories that made sense and played fair with the audience. That being said, Bernal is incredibly good in this film, and I look forward to seeing him in other films. But I just don't think Almodovar has the intelligence, self knowledge or depth to be a great film maker."
30816,"Did anyone else think the singing was absolutely AWFUL???!!!; I absolutely love the Phantom Broadway show...I was so excited about this film. I went tonight and got there and bought the last ticket of a sold-out house. I just knew I was going to be blown away! BOY was I disappointed! The singing was more hideous than the Phantom's face (which actually wasn't hideous at all...what gives with having a mostly handsome Phantom anyway? Kinda defeats the point of the movie, doesn't it?). The Phantom is supposed to be a MUSICAL GENIUS!! And the poor fellow COULD NOT SING!!! I've heard high school chorus guys sound better than this guy. And Minnie Driver...geez, what was SHE doing? That was the worst Carlotta I've ever seen! I cannot believe the casting of this film...it was unfitting ALL the way around. Anyway, the set design was wonderful, but I was even disappointed in the costumes. The Broadway show makes this look like 3rd rate crap. Phantom's masquerade costume was not even scary...in the NY version, he looks really creepy with his skull mask and a really flowing and dominant red outfit. I don't know...I was just so sorry I didn't wait to rent it on video. I would have rather spent my $7.25 on ""A Series of Unfortunate Events."""
2474,"Gratuitous remake with too many defects; Given the general nature of the material and the highly dramatic conclusion of the HUSTLER there was simply no room for a sequel--nothing else to say. Besides, didn't Bert Gordon warn Eddie not to ever walk into a big time pool again? The defects of COLOR are many and varied but we can begin with the flippant quality of almost all the pool shooting scenes. The Hustler's were completely believable and dripping with authenticity. Fats and fast Eddie were pool players who took tremendous pride in their game and comported themselves with great dignity. The fact that Eddie got drunk and made an ass of himself while losing all his money to Fats was used, quite accurately, to demonstrate a major character flaw. The viewer is actually embarrassed for this giggling fool who a moment before was taking Minnesota Fats apart. In COLOR, the kibitzers are frequently overly boisterous and sometimes seemingly crowding the players. In one scene, Cruise actually sets a beer on the table--an act that would result in a prompt and severe admonishment if not ejection in any decent pool room. All that Samurai stuff with the pool cue would likely have gotten his head taken off. The only character who actually slithered around the table and looked like a shooter was Grady, who showed all the grace of an actual hustler. Everyone else, including Newman and Cruise, basically resemble characters out of the game at the local YMCA. A wasted cameo by Steve Mizerak serves for emphasis. There is no chemistry between Newman and Cruise or between Cruise and the young lady. At no time, despite the major premise of the movie, did I feel that these characters were even vaguely interested in one another. The ability of Paul Newman to play a driven, desperate character is central to most of his great roles, (Hombre, Hud, CH Luke) but by the time he made this movie his voice and general delivery were considerably diminished. Not that it would have mattered given this material. Finally, there is always a fine line when it comes to what is honorable hustling and what is an out and out scam. No one is expected to display his best stick from the beginning of the evening, and some gamesmanship is certainly acceptable in any money game, but I found it unlikely that a man who could introduce the ""two brothers and a stranger"" ruse could actually be offended by Vincent's subsequent insistent that he accept half the payoff money from Vincent's dive he took in the match between them. (By the way, wouldn't handing that envelope to Vinny after forfeiting the match sort of make the poor guy a marked man?) The final shot left room for another sequel, thank God that is unlikely to happen at this point"
4890,"super movie!!; Shallow Hal is one of the best that I have ever seen. Really funny is when Hal is hypnotized and does not realize that his so-called ""gorgeous"" girlfriend, Rosemary Shanahan, is actually a 300 pound not-so-hottie. Also funny is when Rosemary, in her thin state in Hal's eyes, kept breaking chairs as if her ""slim"" body were made of lead. I also really laughed when Mauricio lifted the spell, afterwards, Rosemary is totally unrecognizable! then one night, Jill takes Hal out for dinner, Hal is totally unaware that Rosemary is there too, watching him chat with Jill, who is a definite babe, with pain in her heart. Then Hal goes to the payphone to call Rosemary-and passes her in the hallway! Unaware that the big fat woman she passes is Rosemary Shannahan, Hal goes to the phone, while Rosemary walks outside, holding her hand on her heart and crying heavily-and calls Hal a ""psycho"" then at the party, she is so hurt she tells Hal to ""go away"". Well, what would you have done? I would very likely have just let Rosemary slide and gotten back with Jill."
8784,"Garden State of Mind; In all honesty when I first saw this movie in theaters it was only because Natalie Portman is an amazing actress. After seeing any movie, if I continue to think and talk about that movie after a week of seeing I consider it a good movie. Even after a month I was still talking and thinking about Garden State. The main character, Andrew Largman returns home, after nine years of living in California, for his mothers funeral. It is in his home state of New Jersey he finds love and the realization he does not need to be on medication and it is okay to feel something. This drama/comedy is wonderfully balance with the movie's soundtrack adding its own flavor to the mix. Zach Braff wrote, directed, and starred in this movie and for it to come out with such brilliance is an outstanding feat! Sam, portrayed by Natilie Portman, reminds us its okay to cry but it is better to laugh instead. Sometimes you just need to have an original moment and scream your head off."
923,"My brief review of the film; An artistically directed film noir drama with arguably the best black and white photography of all time, Welles uses an extensive range of film techniques, and in particular the lighting used in the film is very impressive. Welles is also superb in the lead role, playing the title character from young adulthood to old age, with the assistance of some excellent makeup. However, as impressive as it is, none of the supporting characters are all that well drawn out or acted and the use of music in the film feels inappropriate and it detracts from certain scenes. In terms of film techniques it was groundbreaking in its time, and is still quite admirable even by standards today, but as an overall film it is just not quite as satisfying as what it could have been. Still, it certainly is interesting in terms of plot, with issues of love, fame and happiness amongst others in the film, and it certainly is a film great."
153412,"""I always order what I don't want""; This is a quiet lesbian romance. A French mother/wife adventures into a world of self-expression, dancing, and lesbianism. The lead is pervaded by a thorough mistrust of her choices and feelings. She is aided in her internal conflict by her friends and husband who attack her with guilt. Will she do the right thing and follow her heart? Or will she succumb to patriarchal, close-minded society? Also a racial sub-theme as the lead's lover is half black. I enjoyed this film, but it makes for a quiet night. You never get the sense that the two women could be truly happy, only that they're a little less miserable together."
2599,"My brief review of the film; An enjoyable, impeccably cast and deftly written high school film that works so well because the premise is realistic even if the execution is hyperbolic. Most have encountered at some point during their schooling a fellow pupil so diligent and successful that they are annoying. Some would have even thought of going to the lengths used by the main character in the film. But despite a good concept, the film lessens in quality as it progresses, because the idea becomes tiresome after a while, and annoying in itself. But the film is nevertheless well photographed, edited and scored throughout, and there are some excellent songs."
6369,"Very cute movie; Despite what rrfrank writes in his comment, ""Only totally undemanding homosexuals desperate for validation will bother with this dog"" I am not undemanding, not desperate for validation and I am not a dog. I am very demanding and I am a bear. (For those that don't know, big hairy gay man.) Yes, the movie drug at several points. Yes, there are far too many stereotypical gay type characters ... overly stereotypical ... looks like a homophobes attempt at creating gay characters. Fabulous! Having grown up during the time when a lot of these stereotypes were the only ""role models"" gay people had it is really amusing to see someone finally making fun of them. I do have to say that you must sit through the entire movie. The first time I saw it, I was not enthused by the title, the cover and the fist fifteen minutes ... truth be known, I went to cook dinner. My other half was watching and would break out laughing ... it became more frequent. I guess it was a good 30 minutes into the movie when I had to come in and watch. Well, I had to finish diner but after fixing out plates I made him start it over from the beginning. I love watching the butch gangsters trying to ""act gay"" - picture big butch guys with guns trying to queen it up. And during the big party, the god father is terrific trying to make sure that one lady has everything she wants to see at the party."
1721,"My Favorite Movie; MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: Masterpiece is a work of art that is a very genuine and rare thing. And this my friend is a masterpiece. Being only 6 when I first saw the film, of course having to close my eyes at a couple of parts, I didn't really get it. But it still made me cry. After that I had my first celebrity crush. Leonardo DiCaprio. Now, I am 13 and have grown to understand heartbreaks, crushes, and more. So, now I know what it is about and it has really touched my heart after watching it 500 billion times. Just like the song ""My Heart Will Go On"" (sung by my fave singer of all time, Celine Dion) this film is unsinkable. This is one of my fave movies. Half of the world has seen it(the movie grossed over $1 billion dollars) so there probably is no point to this but... This movie is about a very wealthy young 17-year-old girl, Rose (Kate Winslet), who is going on a grand adventure upon the most grandest ship, Titanic. Along with her snobby mother, horrible fiancé, and many other cruse characters. While on this ship she meets the poor, but stunningly beautiful, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). They fall in love and Rose decides that she will get off the ship with him when they reach New York. To bad it never happened. Now, everyone knows the tale of Titanic. Late at night, when it was below freezing out, the ship runs into its enemy. The iceberg. Scraping the sides of this beautiful ship and causing it to quickly sink. 2 or 3 hours after it had been hit. Then, the fateful death of many occur and one truly stunningly beautiful young man. Rose grows old and then dies in her sleep. Meeting her one true love again and all of her friends on that grand ship. Then it goes to the credits where Celine Dion sings ""My Heart Will Go On"". At this point I can't even try to sing along because I'm crying so much. In the end I love this movie and it is once again a masterpiece. 10/10"
6753,"wonderful family movie; Rarely I find a movie that after watching....I feel compelled to purchase it. Well, this was one of those charming, endearing and all around wonderful family shows. I was very comfortable watching this with my nine year old twins...and they loved it also. We even stayed on to watch all the edited film and commentaries. It is nice when a movie teaches sensitivity and kindness...rather than endless violence and selfish behaviors that most movies dole out. Walter reminded me of that honesty seen in little Timmy of Timmy and Lassie. I hope you will enjoy this as much as I did...it was a breath of fresh air to see a movie that everyone involved..from the writer to the actors...put in such sincerity and love."
158076,"Simply Beautiful; One of my favorites. Pictures, acting, music, sound all matches perfectly. The both girls are a mystery. Kedzierzawska told at the Berlinale, that after months of casting they already began shooting but the young actors failed and right on the marketplace in the city they shot, they found their ""substitutes"". Good example of the typical (?) polish way to mix fairy tale - atmosphere with artistic strength and docu-like approach to reality. It could change your view on childhood forever. AND it never crosses the thin red line to artsy kitsch, as unfortunately Kedzierzawskas following movie did (where she told the true story of a child murder with Hamilton-like way too soft pictures.)"
99642,"A Real Rarity - A GOOD Direct-to-Video Animated Movie!; CAUTION: Potential Spoilers Ahead! ""Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures"" was always one of my favorite cartoons growing up (heck, it still is). And this movie perfectly captures everything I love about the show and puts it in full-length form. Beautifully animated by the Tokyo Movie Shinsa studio (WB outsourced every ""Tiny Toons"" project, and this was the best studio to handle the show), the movie starts at the end of the school year at Acme Looniversity, the renowned cartoon college where Buster and Babs Bunny (no relation) and their teenage toon peers learn from the masters of animated lunacy, the Looney Tunes. After the final bell, the movie splits off into five different plots. Buster engages Babs in a water gun fight that culminates with a bursting dam and a tidal wave, sending Buster, Babs, and Elmyra's dog Byron downriver on an overturned picnic table in search of adventure in the deep South. Plucky Duck talks Hamton Pig and his family into letting him come with them to HappyWorldLand, ""The Happiest Place in the Western Hemisphere"", but he has to put up with an excruciating car ride and the threat of a chainsaw-wielding hitchhiker. Elmyra's cat Furball finally runs away, but she isn't daunted...not when there are plenty of ""aminals"" to play with at the Acme Safari Park. Fifi la Fume devotes her summer to hunting down her heartthrob, movie star Johnny Pew, in the hopes of getting an autograph. Of course, the hotel he's staying at is nearly impenetrable. And Shirley McLoon sets up a fortune telling booth on the Acme Acres Boardwalk...and lets her guard down on her day off when Fowlmouth takes her to see the horror flick ""Skunkophobia"". All these story lines are sidesplittingly hilarious, and some of them even overlap in the end. The only complaint I have with this movie is that it doesn't make full use of the Tiny Toons roster - Dizzy Devil and Mary Melodie have only one scene, Gogo Dodo only appears at the beginning and end of the film, and Montana Max, Sweetie, Calamity Coyote, and Little Beeper are nowhere to be found. Still, they're excusable flaws in an otherwise perfect film. This movie is pretty rare today, since it's over 12 years old and has never been released on DVD to my knowledge, but I highly suggest you track it down - anyone who's a fan of Warner Bros. animation, either classic or contemporary, NEEDS to see this movie."
30812,"A beautiful look at the life and times of...; Martin Scorsese has done a magnificent job directing the life and story of an eccentric businessman/filmmaker. I think the production has told an intriguing and carefully thought story of the life of Howard Hughes. I recommend this movie to everyone who believe that truth is indeed more fascinating than fiction. The Aviator has dramatized (and, to a lesser degree, romanticized) real life, but the effect only betters the movie. After all, this is Hollywood we're dealing with. It's 1930, and $4 million dollars later, Howard Hughes has created the most expensive movie yet. The flying Great War epic isn't enough for the young Texan as he plans on taking the aviation industry by storm. I enjoyed the perspective of Hollywood in the 30s. There's a magnificent view placed in the movie that makes you wonder if you would be looking through the eyes of Howard Hughes if he was in your seat itself. I would not be surprised if Ms. Blanchett is nominated at the Academy Awards. If you're not into biographical movies, then her performance of Katharine Hepburn deserves some notice. Look for cameos by Gwen Stefani and Jude Law. I didn't recognize the latter. It was a good movie and I wouldn't mind watching it again. But nearly tipping the scales at just under three hours, make sure you get comfortable, with your toilet breaks done and over with."
4695,"better than the book; Maltese Falcon is a better movie than the book, and so is this baby. Good as the books are. Of course there would have been neither without the books, but both books wander all over the place, and are not the better for it. Whereas this one, and Maltese and for that matter, Treasure of Sierra Madre, are the richer experiences on the screen for being tightened down. The casting was perfect here. Even Zerbe is a wonderful surprise. The only cavil I have with the overall effect is the dumb title. Terrible. Dog Soldiers would have been fine. But after that, there is not much amiss here. Starting with the dope deal, quite unlike the start of the novel, it moves relentlessly as a snake from then on to its end, which is also unlike the novel, and the better for it. Robert Stone writes some of the, if not THE finest dialog in modern American literature: I have always had problems with his wandering stories, but if it takes them to produce his characters sparkling talk, what the hell, so be it. And what other movie would even THINK of using Hank Snow's Golden Rocket for the music of a great great shootout. Also not in the book. All hands here can be proud of a work that time is gonna treat with the utmost tenderness. If it has one misstep it is right at the first: the explosions tossing Moriarity around are at distinct odds with the slow buildup of the rest of it. But a minor matter, considering how dead on perfect most of the rest of the film is. So good this one is, it's no wonder that the great masses missed it's perfection."
8521,"One of the finest Classic Horror Films I've ever seen !!; Let me just say that I am one of the biggest classic horror fans you'll find anywhere. I collect pictures, figures, models, etc. My family isn't quite sure what to make out of me, thats OK. I'm 44, and today was the first time I saw Fredric March in the classic Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. What a blast !! His performance, in my opinion, can only be compared to Karloff in Frankenstein. The make-up is incredible, and the special effects are superior to most any film of the era. The split screen effect used is far ahead of it's time as far as anything that I can remember seeing.I'm really not much for words, but if you love or even like classic horror, and haven't seen this one, what are you waiting for!!!!!!!"
175967,"Tiresome with Under-used Actors; This is yet another jerky, hackneyed ""indie"" film. The director sounds like a nice guy, at least he comes across that way in the multiple ""behind the scenes"" stories floating around on DVD and the Internet (www.nobodywantsyourfilm.com). Why Buscemi (and the extremely talented Dinklage) made this is beyond me, maybe they lost a bet? The film had an O.K. start and was set up for some interesting twists. Instead the filmmaker threw so many secondary characters into this (Stormare's crazy Santa, the priests, etc.) the plot just wanders around L.A. in the wee hours. But ending it with the cute kid getting a kidney (oh, please!) and a tearful ending just killed it dead. Nobody wants this film, damn straight."
4370,"Light entertainment that is more of a children's film; We all like to take a trip into someone's prediction of the future. Over the last couple of decades, films set in the unknown that lays ahead for mankind have become common releases. ""A.I."" dabbles in giving us a glimpse, but overall, the premise of the story is about a boy (who is actually a robot) who wants to be loved by his mother, a primal instinct for human beings. Haley Joel Osment plays that boy, David, who becomes a part of a family that wants to replace their own son, who is in a coma. But when the son comes to, and the original family unit is back in place, there is no room for David, and he is forced out into the harsh future world we can only hope doesn't become a reality. He meets Jude Law's Joel, a robot programmed to be an amicable and pleasurable sex partner to women customers. David tells Joel of his need to become a real boy so that his mother will love him and take him back, and they embark on a journey to get David's wish granted. Sounds like a fairy tale you know? Well, A.I. actually recognizes the connections it has with the story of Pinocchio, incorporating them into the film. What Steven Spielberg attempts to do in this film is to get the audience relating to the need for affection that David has, however we get too distracted by the futuristic setting, and the emotional intensity does not sink in, resulting in the film becoming nothing more than light entertainment. Also, the story tends to suddenly shift for the last half an hour, as if the film was taken over by a different director for a sequel. I was quite happy to leave David on the bottom of the ocean with a flooded New York, forever wishing his wish to the blue fairy, expecting to be doing so when we came to this scene. The film lacked depth, and would be more suited to a children's audience if it wasn't for the sexual concepts in the city scenes. Jude Law was not the best choice of actor to play the man of women's dreams, and his English accent also put off the continuity  then again, maybe some girls like English accents, who knows? In the end, I thought the inclusion of alien life form was unnecessary and took away any dignity the film had. Spielberg has impressed me before with mixing human emotion with fantastic tales, but this one just didn't seem like the right amount of each ingredient."
122100,"""Auf Wiedersehen, Sidney""; No, John Wayne and his crew don't speak German, but what do you expect of a film from this era? In Ben-Hur the Romans speak with British accents and the Jews speak with American accents. The same line of reasoning applies here. The English have British accents and the Germans have American accents. Accept it and move on. Once one can get past the accent issue, this is really quite a good film. All of the credit in the world goes to John Wayne for making this film. Made in the mid-50's, just ten years after the end of World War II, I would imagine it was not very popular subject matter at the time. It is one of the few Hollywood films to try to show the Second World War from the German point of view. Karl Ehrlich (Wayne) is a man torn between his love for his country and his personal hatred for the ideals of Hitler. He is an officer of the old school Prussian monarchy still loyal to the Kaiser who does not like the new regime. As Jeff Napier (David Farrar) notices, he flies the swastika outside on his ship but still has the old imperial battle flag hanging in his cabin. He must decide whether to allow his ship to be taken or defy the entire British Navy and try to bring the Ergenstrasse back safely to the Fatherland. The flag he flies during the final battle is a telling sign of where his loyalty lies and (in my opinion) is Ehrlich's explanation for his actions. An interesting, intriguing, and thought-provoking war film."
9018,"I'm showing CONTROL ROOM in my college film class; It is vitally important in our America-centric culture that educators expose other points-of- view whenever possible. That is why I'm showing CONTROL ROOM in the film classes I'm teaching at Minnesota State University, Mankato. This documentary is not nearly as one-sided as FAHRENHEIT 9/11, nor as emotion provoking. In fact, the filmmakers seem to have edited their work with anticipated criticism it would receive from the right-wing elements of the American press. Perhaps that is why it seems to have been greeted with somewhat of a ""ho hum"" from both ends of the political spectrum. Since it succeeds in steering a middle course it has not attracted the controversy, nor the attention, received by Michael Moore's work. This said, CONTROL ROOM is a fascinating work that treats the American Marine who is the U.S. Central Command spokesperson with the same sympathy as the Arab staffers who work for Al-Jazeera. Compared to most of the plonk that is supposed to entertain us in theaters or on DVD today, CONTROL ROOM easily soars above the crowd."
30816,Beautiful; I've grown up watch and listening to Phantom. I even have a Phantom glass mask in my room that play Masquerade. When my mom first took me to see I figured it wouldn't be as good as the play because no one can do it like the original. I was deeply wrong I'm happy to say. It was done beautifully ever from the chandelier to the Phantoms cave to the fire. In fact I'm going to see it for the second time in 3 days tomorrow. I have to saw Phantom of the Opera is the best movie of the year. 2 thumbs way way up. Plus the Phantom is a babe!!!!!!!! Go see it everyone its worth all the money and heck you don't have to get dressed up!
8983,"6/10 Same old lousy wire work and tiresome fighting antics. Low on visual splendor, except when there's too much of it.; I had high hopes for this movie. I saw Hero and loved it. I was expecting fantastically colored visuals, exceptional acts of acrobatic fighting, a *few* cheesy physics-defying stunts, and a plot worth caring about. Instead, I got a mediocre movie that tries really really really hard to fulfill Hollywood's rule of followup films: whatever people liked about the first film, give 'em three times as much in the second film. I can suspend reality, I can easily accept an alternate reality as long as it's consistent. I can accept a world where people can become lighter than air and launch objects with impossible accuracy ('impossible' due to uncontrollable variations such as, say, air turbulence). But if they can't control the rotation of their body (whilst being lighter than air, recall) and land on the ground like an Olympic gold medalist, then they'd better not show up on my movie screen. My biggest gripe about these sorts of films: stupid wire work. These directors can't seem to ever get it right. Hey, I've got no problem with people being able to stand on a tiny tree limb without falling, and leap from said tiny limb and fly through the air in a horizontal line, but if they rotate just a wee bit in the wrong direction, and land on the ground awkwardly as though they were, say, suspended from a wire, then the illusion is shattered, their hard work is worthless, and my head is slowly shaking back and forth. Bah! The use of slow motion, while it can be effective, does not make a movie an Asian epic, nor does it move the movie along smartly. This movie used slow motion too often, most of the time to show us some camera effects for the sake of camera effects. No substance in that. OK, enough of that. Onto the visuals. I found the colors washed out, except for a few scenes where they were very rich. I found some scenes were showing us scenery at the expense of momentum. Yeah, it's a nice place, move it along please. Plot. The plot was fine. No complaints. So overall, I have to say my experience in this movie was ho-hum. The two ladies in front of me thought I was objecting to the focus placed on human interaction, and wrote me off as a samurai wannabe until I remarked that the original version of Shall We Dance is worth their time. That just confused them...but I digress. The movie is not a waste of time if you have something to do while you watch it, like knit a scarf, or if you are bored and there is no other movie to see, or if you just kinda want to dumb things down and watch some nice special effects, apart from the stupid wire work. Good luck. 6/10"
169660,"Phew!; Andy Milligan, the independent movie maker from New York, directs this little ""treat"" as his version of the Sweeney Todd legend. Sweeney slits the throats of customers in his barbershop and his cohort Mrs. Lovett turns them into meat pies. Thankfuly I was well-informed of the plot prior to seeing this film travesty. Milligan, for my money, has to indeed be running in the lead of worst directors of all-time race. Ed Wood looks like Orson Welles in comparison. This movie is so bad in oh so many ways. Let's take Milligan's direction for starters. The film quality is grainy. The sound quality is grainy. Many scenes look as if Milligan was using a camcorder to film. The credits say ""Photograped and directed by Andy Milligan."" He wants to take credit for ceilings showing up after a death scene? How about the atrocious musical score selected for the film? The film cuts with one poor transition after another. Little logic is used in the creation of the plot. The story has little to do with the actual legend of Todd. The murder scenes are plentiful but not horrifying in any way. Hands, legs, and other appendages are cut with the skill in which the editing was done: choppily! And let's take the breast in the pie scene. Yes, it is in there. The pie maker didn't know that an entire breast with nipple filled an entire pie crust? Later we hear from our characters that they ""have been careful not to get caught"" for the 200 plus murders they have done. Obviously they are a couple of boobs not able to keep abreast of what is going on(sorry it was too tempting). The actors are not too terribly bad to be honest. Some even have glimmers of talent, and all seem to be genuine English articles. Many non-erotic nude scenes are forced throughout. Milligan seemingly has some issues regarding sex. Plot strands are left untied. The ending is almost unwatchable due to poor camera work. I could go on and on. Did I like anything about the film? Not much to be truthful. I have a high level of acceptance for films of this ilk in terms of low budgets and marginal talent, but this film lacks any real purpose other than to be crude and sick."
8783,"Great Film!!!; This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I love the way Night makes his movies they are always original and creative. He makes you really care about the characters and you hope they will be OK... the ending was great though most people didn't like it. I can't wait until his next film. If you want to watch a good movie this is it. Scary,creative,chilling,original these are just some of the words that describe this film. Go get it on DVD it's great. The DVD contains a old movie that Night did when her was just a kid, it's like indiana jones its pretty funny. Night is my favorite director and will remain my favorite because he never disappoints he makes great films."
7160,"Aileen Carol Wuornos (2/29/59 - 10/9/02); This movie is not for everyone. It's hard to take & depressing. It's the story of a lost, tortured soul who was certainly ""walking wounded"". She was a serial killer & by all accounts only the first killing was justified & the lowlife deserved his fate. The film tells the story of Aileen (Lee) Wuornos without justifying what she did. The viewer actually gets to know her as a human being & I sympathized with her to a degree. It's the humanization of her that made me sympathize with her. Otherwise, she'd just be another nut-job/hooker/murderer who also got what she deserved. There are some insights into her here & there in the film (molested as a child, raped by a family ""friend"", beaten by her father who later committed suicide, discarded by her siblings, became a prostitute at 13 to survive, battered by partners & cops, alcoholism etc.) that make you feel that this somewhat powerless & uneducated woman actually became addicted to killing once she started because it was a release of anger & hatred that had built up inside of her for so many years. I also felt sympathy for her because she wanted to ""go straight"" & work but she set her sights too high & was knocked down once again. Granted, the attempt to straighten her life out was mostly out of fear of being caught after she killed the first guy in self defense, but she also loved Selby & possibly wanted more ""nomalcy"" for them as a couple in that respect as well. I know the movie takes liberties with some facts. For example, the real Selby was not a whiny, naive nineteen year old, but a big bruiser who enjoyed instigating & egging Wuornos on into fights with others. Charlize Theron deserved her Oscar for portraying & transforming herself into this complex woman with so much passion & dedication."
30825,"This time it is time to ""Meet The Fockers""; WHOA! When I heard they were making a sequel to Meet The Parents, it was obvious what it would be about, and even called. To tell the truth, I couldn't wait. I loved the first movie. This movie was 10 times better! Once again we enter the life of one Gaylord Focker, still having the odd problem with his girlfriends/fiancée's parents. This time it is time to ""Meet The Fockers"". Just when the movie starts to feel like the original, Babara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman enter the movie, and improve it in so many ways. The level of humor seems to go up and doesn't slump til the end of the movie. There are many surprises along the way. I don't want to say too much more though. The audience was in stitches, most people I know enjoyed it and it is just plain fun to watch this amazing cast work together. Check it out for a great night at the movies. I do recommend you watch the fist film though. Enjoy!"
8870,"The Alternate Ending on the DVD is well worth it!; Instead of going into a detailed review of this movie, I would just like to point out that the DVD of The Forgotten offers the possibility to view the Theatrical Release or the Extended Version which contains an alternate ending. The Extended Version runs 8 minutes longer than the Theatrical version. Basically, the changes consist of 2 scenes that were cut off the Theatrical Release + the alternate ending. If you have not seen this movie yet, GIVE YOURSELF A FAVOR and watch the EXTENDED VERSION. The alternate ending is TOTALLY DIFFERENT and in my humble opinion a lot more in tune with the rest of the movie. I have not seen this movie in theaters and I decided to watch the Extended Version first. I'm glad I did! After the viewing, I decided to check the Theatrical Ending and I can totally understand why many people have talked negatively about the ""Hollywood Ending"" of The Forgotten. The Extended Version fixes that very well. I cannot understand why this was not the version showed in theaters. All in all: good acting, good story - 8/10."
3739,"A Comedy Classic That Deserves More Recognition; When friends don't understand my fascination with old films, I often tell them to look for this one on late night tv (typically at 3:30 a.m., usually cut up into a hundred commercials). To me, it has the same rhythmic dialogue, silliness, and one-two punchlines that made ""Bringing Up Baby"" many people's favourite.  Excellent actors - Herbert Marshall, Miriam Hopkins, Edward Everett Horton, and even more - all are absolutely perfect in this film.  The story and its scenery run like clockwork, but the best part is its cleverness which keeps you giggling on and off through the whole film.  Can anyone who has seen this masterpiece (which needs to be saved so future generations may also view it) believe that no one has yet marketed it on video or DVD?  Time is certainly a-wastin'!"
170283,"Makes one think about the paradoxes of time travel; Zapping through the movie channels last evening, I came across: Next feature presentation: Thrill Seekers with Martin Sheen. I wonder if one could sue the channel for this kind of tendentious (but not factually wrong) publicity? Anyway, it made me decide to watch. Hardly any Martin Sheen, but entertaining for sure, and with surprisingly decent special effects for a TV movie. The plot is intelligent, and would be a good starting point to get people to discuss the paradoxes of time travel. Suppose you could go back and kill Hitler before he came to power, would you do it? But if you would, can you be certain nothing worse would happen? And how would it affect your own life? Would you still exist, even? (My parents met because of the war.) Or: if you go back to a time after you are born, can you meet yourself? All of this is hardly original, of course. SF writers in the golden age (which was sadly ended by Star Wars, shifting from intelligent writing to blockbuster special effects) frequently tackled the issue, for instance describing the butterfly effect: a firm organises time trips to the Jurassic, where thrill seeking (again!) hunters can kill a dinosaur a fraction of a moment before it would have died, thus not altering the time line. But one hunter stumbles and accidentally kills a butterfly. He gets back to his starting date, but the killed butterfly has changed the time line and this new line turns out to be the hunter's worst nightmare. Something similar happens in Thrill Seekers. But here the protagonist has the means to go back in time to change a future he has already experienced. This, of course, was already obvious from the moment they take the laptop from the disaster tourist. In fact, Merrick could have used that device to go back to before he boarded the plane and, using some kind of subterfuge, a bomb alarm for instance, avert the plane crash, and the subway crash, and the fire... But we wouldn't have had the same film then. One question of logic though. If Merrick goes back into his original time line, the time guards would also be in there, but unaffected by what will happen later. In the film, they follow Merrick back from the future. The film does not explain this. But the question doesn't end there. If you go back to when you were 3 hours earlier, you would also not yet have any memories of what was going to happen those next 3 hours. Merrick and the time guards should not have had any knowledge of the disaster happening 3 hours in the future. I also wonder how the title sequence relates to the film. I admit I wasn't paying a lot of attention, trying to figure out when Martin Sheen would be mentioned, but in retrospect I wonder if there wasn't any subtle message in the sequence?"
6541,"Shane West; I personally thought that Shane West brought a great touch to L.X.G. I thought that he was hot, talented and had a great role. Bravo Shane! Bring on some more! He was a fantastic actor- I love him! This movie definitely upgraded himself on the Hollywood charts! Also, Sean Connery and the guy who played the Invisible man were excellent too! I loved Rodney Skinners character- he brought a 'touch' to the movie. The ending left me on the edge of my chair- what happened? I thought this movie was great and I'd definitely see it 100 times more! Peta Wilson was great- but I don't thinks he really got into her role as much as she could. I must admit- when Grey turned out to be evil I was surprised! It was an excellent twist in the story. I also loved the car scene where Shane West was driving! All over, and excellent movie!"
2253,"Look past; While on the outside the movie seems absurd and dumb if you analyze the movie further a strong message is hidden in it. It's a magnificent satire of the stupidity of war. The idea of nations fighting nations and using death as a tool of diplomacy. That's the point of the movie. To make fun of the idea of war in a satirical and silly way. I think Robin Williams does a hilarious job of portraying the peaceful and innocent good guy. He articulates his opinion on the idea of violence in the movie very well. Of course it is funny - Robin Williams is the funniest man alive. And Joan Cusak is always a fun character to watch in a movie. She is able to convey a since of happiness in all of her parts. Lastly, Robin Wright was great in the Princess Bride and she is great in this one too. Look pass the simple idea of the movie and see the real big picture. 8.5/10"
100001,"Wish They Had Made a Full Length, Silent Feature Instead.; This is one film that I wish was on DVD. As a fan of silent comedy, this film has long been one of my favorites. More of a biography of Buster Keaton then the film The Buster Keaton Story. While the actual film has flaws, the best parts for me are the recreations of silent comedies. They're hilarious!! It makes me wish that Reiner and Van Dyke had chosen instead to make a full length, silent comedy. It would have been a classic today! As it is, the film was probably made at the wrong time for it to have made an impact. It probably seemed very out of date in the year of Easy Rider and Woodstock. However, anyone who's a fan of Keaton and Chaplin or silent movies should really make an effort to find this film, it's obviously made with a love of the subject matter."
30816,"Brava!; Wonderfully done film version of the Broadway musical. I've seen the musical in NYC several times, read the book and seen this film several times. The film corresponds with the musical except in only a few instances and both the musical and film versions correspond faithfully to the book, with only slight differences, a few additional characters and the timing of the chandelier incident. In every instance where I've seen the film in several venues, audiences have packed the theatre and applauded or sat quietly afterward. Leroux always meant for his Phantom of the Opera to be a rewrite of the Beauty and the Beast tale. It was not meant to be a horror story but a touching tale of love and redemption. Another writer says the only thing he found wanting was that there were a few times when the ""illusion"" of the actors singing was broken. No illusion! Andrew Lloyd Webber only agreed to the film version if the actors could sing their own parts. A couple of times the editing is off slightly, but the actors are all singing their own parts and that is obvious if you watch closely. Loved it. Everyone I know who's seen it has loved it. Ignore the critics and go to see this film."
91488,"Great Holiday Short!; I can't tell you how much I adore this movie. I saw it for the first time on Christmas morning when I was six years old, and I watched it every year until I was ten-when i moved and it no longer appeared on t.v. It's a great Christmas movie for kids, and though it gets a little boring as you get older, it can still get your heart thumping and your imagination flowing as an adult. The short-film is about the story of a young boy who makes a snowman that comes to life, and the adventures that this boy shares with his snowman. Though the ending to the story can generate some tears, it's well worth watching and an all-together excellent short film. 10/10"
8781,"you suck; God, you people don't know what the heck you are talking about. Denzel will always be way cooler than any of you.....he is the flippin man....so what if the mom almost kisses the son, that stuff was gross...but I hope you all get attacked by ninjas. Anyway, who cares about the original? the only thing that was great about that movie was Frank Sinatra and he's not even living anymore,God rest his soul...I loved this movie..especially the remake of Fortunate Son by Wyclef...you people don't get that its not about the unbelievable plot line or the original, its about how there are actually people that the government wanted to do this to, but decided no to....Its some what factual and thats what counts....besides, Meryl Streep is the perfect megalomaniac mother...its a choice role for her...i say good acting and good movie...eat it"
8784,"Overall plot lacking but rich in the details; If ever there was a reason not to extensively read the reviews before the movie, the gushing reviews for Garden State on IMDb are reason enough. Overwhelmed with ""generation defining"" tags, I expected a little too much from this warm but mostly inoffensive drama. Although I found the rites of passage story to be a little contrived and unoriginal, there were enough details and scenarios in the film that kept me laughing along, and interested. Characters are inventive and quirky whilst still being believable. It's good, but it didn't quite hit the right chord with me that I expected it too. The ending also, seemed tagged on to please the mainstream. I felt it would have been a better film if the last minute hadn't have played out. Worth a watch, but might not change your life as predicted!"
152529,"Masterpiece of silent cinema; This would have been one of my recommendations if it had nothing else but Corinne Griffith starring in it. She is, as usual, marvelous. And beautiful. And charming. As usual. But in addition, it is magnificently directed by Lewis Mileston. He has created a visual masterpiece of the silent cinema. I remember some of my film school classmates (too many years ago) being so impressed by ""The Scarlet Letter,"" and exclaiming how modern it looked. Too many people think movies went from ""The Great Train Robbery"" to Chaplin shorts to ""The Jazz Singer."" They just don't know how films evolved. Later silent films often used a very mobile camera that made them more ""movies"" than many early talkies. ""The Garden of Eden"" is a prize example of how to enhance a story with visuals. Milestone used pictures to make this motion picture tell the tale, although there were lots of intertitles. (Another example is ""Lady Windermere's Fan,"" based on a story by the very verbal Oscar Wilde but still made enjoyable to watch by director Ernst Lubitsch's photographic technique.) ""The Garden of Eden"" is fun, well acted, beautifully directed, and more than worth the hour-and-a-half it takes to watch."
30816,"A fresh take on a classic masterpiece; This is an outstanding movie. It's great that today's youth is being given the opportunity to enjoy Andrew Lloyd Weber's masterpiece Phantom of the Opera. I have never seen the original Broadway production but I did see the movie with someone who did. She noted that many parts were added and that songs were changed... but not necessarily in a bad way. Just be sure that if you have seen and/or heard the original Phantom of the Opera that you set aside what you remember from it and approach this film with a fresh mind set. Clearly the singers are different but different isn't bad. The Phantom's voice is pleasantly deep without any of that piercing falsetto from the original and Christine's character is superb in both her acting and singing. It truly is a marvelous work and I would definitely see it a third time (yes, I've seen it twice already at nearly $9 a pop!) Trust me, you'll love this rendition of The Phantom of the Opera."
6333,"Wolverine 2; Wolverine is back! And so are the rest of the X-Men, I guess. This time around, we have a new bad guy, and some new X-Men. 'X2' opens with a teleporting mutant attacking the White House and making an attempt on the President's life. Instantly recognizable to anyone who reads the comics, this new guy is Nightcrawler, and he seems to be under some sort of mind-control. Soon after, the Xavier Institute is attacked by General Stryker, a mutant-hater who seems to know secrets about Wolverine's past. The X-Men are scattered, and Professor X missing, they must team up with former foes to find Stryker and stop his dastardly plans. It must have been hard to top 'X-Men', but Bryan Singer and David Hayter did it again. While 'X2' doesn't blow 'X-Men' out the water, it is better. With most of the characters already introduced and a longer running time, we get treated to a better story and some new characters, and even nods to the fans with a great many references to other characters, events, and places from the comics. The human / mutant bigotry remains the main theme, but this time the villain is a human with anti-mutant intentions, as opposed to the mutant with anti-human intentions from the first movie. Action and special effects are still top-notch. Colussus even makes a small appearance, and his metal skin is done very well. All the fight scenes are better, and Wolverine's final fight with (Lady) Deathstrike completely outshining the showdown between Wolverine and Sabretooth in the first movie. Other scenes (including Nightcrawler attacking the White House and the assault on the Xavier Institute) are exciting and executed perfectly. Unfortunately, I have a few more complaints this time around. Cyclops has even less screen-time than he had in the first film, and he is supposed to be the X-Men's leader! Like seemingly everyone else, I didn't like Halle Berry as Storm. She just isn't the wise, but powerful Storm from the comics. On a similar note, I didn't like the film's interpretation of Lady Deathstrike. She has one line in the entire movie, and should not be playing second-fiddle to General Stryker. I have a feeling she was thrown in just because of the association with Wolverine. Speaking of Wolverine, he is my favourite of the X-Men, but the movie does center around him again. Either make a Wolverine movie or an X-Men movie. In more Wolverine news, Kitty Pryde appears in one scene, just as she did in the first. She is another of my favourites, and I'd like to see her do a little bit more than appear as a nod to the fans. Overall, 'X2' is better than 'X-Men', but you really have to see 'X-Men' before watching this, especially for those who aren't fans of the comics. It has a nice ending, leaving room in 'X-Men 3' for one of the biggest story-arcs in 40 years of X-Men comics - 9/10"
63676,"whiny faceless guys complains; This is a nice movie about a whiny faceless complaining. There is another half faceless who has her face licked by her brother before walking into the ocean to die. the whiny faceless has a nice beard which he uses to try to trick a retard girl. his wife is not impressed. i give it 7. the doctor is a sicko and wants everyone to be faceless because he says there would be no crime that way. i don't get what he meant by that. i guess he's referring to the low crime rate in china. i don't know what i meant by that. anyway, it makes u think a lot. i suggest you get your hands on a copy of this gem. It's very cerebral in that way. Sometimes when i was watching this movie, i couldn't help thinking if i had the power to change my face, who i would try to seduce. i don't think it would be my wife like this guy did, mostly because i don't have a wife. if you are going for a faceless theme, this movie makes a good double feature with Eyes Without A Face. that's a french film. This movie should not be confused with the Mel Gibson classic Man Withoug A Face."
7090,"A hint more believability wouldn't hurt; Firstoff let me say that this movie is visually stunning! The cinematography, set dressing, costumes, props and sets were all simply ""off the charts"". The rain drops, the flowing drapery, the leaves blowing in the wind - all of it was simply enchanting. But... there just isn't much substance to the rest of it. Why must we completely suspend any sense of the rational in order to watch this? This is my same complaint with ""Crouching Tiger - Hidden Dragon"", must we abandon any comprehension of the basic laws of physics? People don't fly, or float suspended in midair or run across water - no matter how skilled they may be in the martial arts. I personally feel the films would benefit GREATLY by making the characters a little more real and subject to the laws of gravity and motion that everyone else has to live within. And then there's the actual story. Lots of somber moments of introspection and vapid bits of David Carrodine ""Kung Fu"" -esque philosophy. ""I have looked at the calligraphy and now comprehend the essence of the universe"" - Yeah, uh huh. Maybe it's the genre I don't care for. I dunno. I really love the overall look of the film, I'm just disappointed that so little is done with it. Lots of meaningless fighting, a bit of pseudo, inscrutable Asian philosophy, and an ultimately, pretty shallow story. It could have been so much more with just a little bit better writing."
31424,"Alone in the dark is how you might feel in the theater...alone; The Abskani tribe, an ancient demon-worshiping civilization that mysteriously vanished 10,000 years ago, becomes the obsession of a mad archaeologist, Dr. Hutchinson. His fixation with the Abskani turns him on a 22-year crusade to usher those same demons into today's world. Unbeknown to Edward Carnby (Slater) a paranormal detective, and his girlfriend Dr. Aline Cedrac (Reid), they possess the key artifact to unleashing these menaces of terror. And they'll need the help of Commander Burke (Dorff) and the government's top secret ""Bureau 317"" to fight zombies and battle demons in order to stop Hutchinson before he re-opens the door of eternal darkness. Based on the popular Atari video game series, Alone In the Dark, holds true to most paranormal thrillers. Fast paced, killer action, streamlined special effects, and gripping suspense. Unfortunately, a poor storyline, undeveloped structure, and pathetic cliché acting suffocate those highlights. Looking for a sequel? After such an anti-climatic, open-ended conclusion, it deserves one. Then againmaybe not. But, if an audience is only concerned with what's on the surface, then this movie may become quite engaging. The 'scares,' special effects, and action sequences are comparable to its recent sister movies. Its like Residents Evil meets Dreamcatcher meets Starship Troopers. Just when the last AK47 blows away the final 'scorpio-dog-worm-like' demon another one strikes from behind. The movie also has some well-done makeup effects. There is a scene where a Bureau 317 agent's head is split in half, it looks realfrom what I could imagine."
32015,"wacky, bloody; A friend of mine was able to get ahold of a DVD of this flick and brought it to a movie night - Oh my God it blew me away! Wacked. But brilliant, too, in it's dark, harsh wit (nothing is sacred, not even goats). Definitely different, definitely surprising and delightful. I love independent film and occasionally the raw freshness of first films (that is, if they're not just trying to emulate Hollywood), and this had that fresh touch without being clumsy, and enough real smarts to make me feel like I was on the ground floor of something great. It's a comedy that makes fun of fear-fueled ""family"" values and all things self- righteous. Four actors meet at a casting call for the role that each of them has fashioned their (very different) lives after. The role: Jesus. Who gets the part? None of them. So they hit the road together, but end up facing a horrible world filled with back- woods xenophobes and a coke-snorting gang of Elvises. How will each of them use their image of holiness to concur these evils? Can I just say that the Black Power Jesus was fantastic. Like most things holy: beautiful, powerful, and ridiculous."
32015,"Hilarity embodied!; This movie was brilliant!! It starts you out in a hilarious take of a real-life situation, and by the end, you can't believe where you have landed! The outrageously, in your face humor, was surpassed only by the subtle moments of farce. The characters were ludicrous, and in a great way. And the story line is enough to make you pee in your pants. Definitely not for the weak of heart, or humor. It pokes fun at a whole range of humanity. It is definitely the little hidden gems of humor that were my favorite. Its one of those movies, that the more you watch it, the more little bits you notice every time. Definitely see this movie, and get ready to laugh..."
32015,"Great Concept film!; Its sounds like one of those religious jokes "" four Jesus's walk into a bar......""What follows is a bar brawl with Elvis impersonators, including a ""Midget Elvis"" (Elvi?)and unfair incarceration. A crooked town administration and Jury and a coven of witches round out the excellent and intricate cast of characters in this comedy/horror. It is unfortunate that this incredibly entertaining and sometime cynical film is listed in some circles as campy, this film is definitely more witty than the term 'Camp' implies. Although Troma film fans will not be disappointed. The plot follows four wannabe actors all vying for the part of Jesus in a play, who lose the part to the plays director. THey head to New York on a cross country road trip(on Motorcycles no less!) and end up in a completely screwed up small town where the townspeople are messed up and good intentions go bad, and where a savior is the most unlikely one. Throw in a few dozen 'undead'and the plot takes off! Gr Gory Gory is especially applicable in todays political climate. Highly recommended."
32015,"4 Jesus' walk into a bar...; Each time I see this movie I love it even more. Director Sue Corcoran has conjured up a fast-paced and wonderfully shot feature for fans of the midnight movie genre. My personal favorite scene: a knock down, drag out, balls-to-the-wall brawl between a motley gang of Elvis impersonators and our 4 Jesus protagonists. Or maybe its the MGM musical number at the end complete with singing and dancing zombies. It's debauchery with a message, mayhem with a moral, and of course the most glamorous apocalypse imaginable. Gory Gory Hallelujah is delightfully shocking, whip-smart and funny as hell. With stellar acting performances from the cast and a great score to accompany the action."
32015,"A wonderful and delightful rare treat; A wonderful and delightful rare treat. A laid back movie that allows for one being open to possibility. Funny and not to concerning total enjoyment,if your open? I found myself thinking about GOry Gory Hallelujah 2. Though I realized sometimes or most times you can not repeat the simple things. Nice to see a movie like this in times like ours, light and enjoyable. I can not remember seeing a movie, with roots to the local community give so much. All the characters brought a deal of realism about themselves to the screen. This for me made the movie, we all can identify with the characters, thus allowing for laughter. I added this one to my personal Library."
6643,"Stunningly Dull; My wife and I were able to see this film at a cold and draughty venue such as is only proper for a local Film Club. My wife dozed fitfully throughout but I was cursed with a bout of insomnia. This is a very dull film by any standards and the static cinematography does not do justice to what could well be ravishingly beautiful shots of post-war Japan. The acting is extremely mannered. The dialogue (though this could be the fault of the translation) is some of the most clichéd I have ever seen in a movie. Worst of all though, I believe Tokyo Story suffers from a problem that many modern American blockbusters exhibit. As a viewer I got the message loud and clear by the time the old couple leave Tokyo and everything after that was superfluous. I couldn't believe how many extra scenes followed. Apart from the daughter-in-law, all the children are ungrateful brats. Yes, thank you. It's obvious how badly they are all going to act when the mother dies and showing it is just an insult to our intelligence. ""Stop the film"" I wanted to cry out time and time again. A good example of the redundancy is right at the end: shot of old man looking lonely; shot of river; shot of old man; shot or river; closer shot of river. I can only think that you need a much closer affinity with Japanese culture to understand the subtleties. Either that or be a pretentious film critic. I would also add that I do not consider myself to a philistine or addicted to modern action films. I am in my fifties and have a very wide taste in film. Kurusawa's film Ikuru is one of my all time favourites and it has a lot in common with Tokyo Story but IMHO it is superior in every aspect to this over-rated and stupendously dull movie."
1162,"The Ruling Class is Brilliant and Charming; That idiot from DC- ""larcher"" who wrote that the film's only good up to the reading of the will is a complete goof ball. THe film is charming and splendidly done. Peter O'Toole is at his best and perfectly brilliant. Alistair Sim is hysterical. The play by Peter Barnes is also brilliant- the idea, for example, that for someone to become evil, evil has to be done to them, is played out in it; and it is hardly a satire limited to the specific ""ruling class"" of England. Besides the film is so entertaining in its side-items and so charming simply because of O'Toole that even if the play wasn't brilliant the film still would be. THe Ruling Class is also an original, there really isn't anything else out there like it."
30749,"Outstanding!; This is one of the best movies I have seen. Certainly the best so far this year. I am embarrassed to say I was ignorant of the events in Rwanda in 1994. Like one character in the movie said, people in other countries will see this on TV and say it is so horrible, but then they will go out and eat dinner. This movie skillfully tells of the horrors - the conflicts between Tutsis and Hutus, the genocide, without overdramatizing it. It was more like telling the facts. It held my attention from beginning to end. SPOILERS AHEAD................ I remember one scene is particular. Paul (Don Cheadle's character) and his van driver are returning to the hotel late at night and suddenly the road is bumpy. Paul asks the driver to stop the van and steps out. Actually he falls out because he has just stepped on a corpse, and then the horrifying scene- he is surrounded by a very large number of corpses. There are also some very warm moments in the movie- Paul's family, his friends, employees, acquaintances, and the 'powerrful' people- his relationships to them are portrayed beautifully. He uses all his negotiations skills to save lives of over 1200 people. Without him they would have certainly died. He was a real hero who never gave up. The acting and direction were great. Don Cheadle is brilliant as Paul. I hope he will be nominated for the Oscar. He gets excellent support from the cast, and particularly Sophie, who plays his wife in the movie. It is hard to describe in words how effective this movie is. All I can say is- Go see it."
3786,A movie to be enjoyed; I saw this movie only a few weeks after I realized I was gay and I found it tender and heart-warming. The film plays on common stereotypes with ease and the performances of Lyonne and DaVuall are extremely powerful. The sex scenes are tastefully done and the messages are clear: You should be proud of who you are. The relationship between Megan and Gram are the basic of the movie. The music is corny but fits perfectly with the scenes. The sets are elaborate and use color creatively. This movie is one of my favourites and uses many dramatic elements such as comedy and drama to create a movie that is beautiful and yet powerfully funny at the same time.
144686,"Hrishikesh Mukherjee shows his genius.; Chupke Chupke is masterpiece by Hrishikesh Mukherjee, I love his style of story telling be it Bawarchi, Rang Birangi, Naram Garam, Golmaal, Khubsoorat, Buddha Mil Gaya, all of which are great movies. All his stories have very simple storyline, powerful cast, lots of human emotion and patriotism towards Indian culture and languages. Dharmendra is truly amazing, and so is Amitabh Bachchan and rest of the cast supports them well. Since most of the dialogs are in pure Hindi, some people may find it difficult to follow. Hrishikesh Mukherjee through his movies and characters always pointed to some aspect or the other of the lives of Indian people, and hence all his characters always feel very real and get deep inside your skin and you become a part of the act. The practical joke played by a Botany professor on his brother-in-law is the focus of the movie, as pointed out by other commenter. Chupke Chupke is a film in which the dialogs combine with the situations to collectively impart the comic momentum to the movie which persist till the very last minute, very very entertaining film, highly recommended for the entire family. If you liked this movie, then do give the movies mentioned at the beginning a shot, you would thank me later. :) also highly recommended."
8977,"Oliver Stone is surprising,as always; I am a very big fan of Oliver Stone. One of the things I like about him is that he always surprises me,no matter how ""predictable"" he may seem. Here are my comments: 1. I didn't read any comments here on IMDb that said this is not a typical 100% historical movie.I am surprised,because a lot has been said about this movie. Some of Alexander's and Ptolemy's monologues and some ideas that come from this movie have references on very actual issues: East meets West,tolerance to other cultures (mainly Eastern culture).Stone risks a lot here by trying to add this kind of ideas to an already very complex subject.He may have overdone it a bit,but it would be nice to imagine Alexander having Gandhi or Martin Luther King type of ideas.Of course,it is extremely hard to imagine a ruthless military leader preaching racial and cultural tolerance to his battle-hardened generals,but hey, Napoleon is also an example that such peculiar personalities do exist.So, it seems plausible,and historical facts do support this theory about Alexander. 2. About casting: I think Colin Farell was a good choice.A lot have said that he was too today-looking and lacked the greatness of Alexander.But who really knows what Alexander was like? Stone and Farell delivered a perfectly believable character. Kilmer and Jolie were excellent, and also the others were good choices, as far as I am concerned. 3. About the bisexuality theme: no comments here, except that maybe Americans should try to be a little less puritan (it is the 21-st century,grow up!) 4.Screenplay and story were excellent.Very original and very dramatic.The subject was extremely demanding and Stone did a very good job. 5. I think it is a shame that the movie was so criticized. Very underrated movie. 6.Allthough overall Vangelis' music was OK, I do think that he could have done a better job. The battle scenes music (esp.the one at Gaugamela) is a bit too common. 7.The Oscars and the Golden Globes have proved, one more time, that they are sometimes blind. This movie definitely deserved more recognition. The comparison with ""Gladiator is mostly incorrect. Ridley Scott is very different from Oliver Stone. Of course, you can make some comparisons (afterall, it is about antiquity, emotions, heroics, love and so on). I thought Gladiator was a great movie, and so is Alexander. But Alexander was about a very known figure and it set itself a higher target. And Gladiator does have a big flaw in the story, which is Commodus in the arena (that was uninspired, Mr. Scott), just like another excellent Scott film, Black Hawk Dawn, with those last dialogs btw soldiers (cheesy!). But that's just the point. Stone, in most of his movies, is unable (I think he does that on purpose) to deliver a final punch. So, for those viewers that want an ending, no matter how absurd, Scott makes it better (but loses its artistic value in the process). So 2 great directors, but different, Stone takes more risks and usually has a very personal agenda. My rating is 9/10, because of 2 minuses: didn't really enjoy Vangelis and those Hopkins monologues were a bit forced. Overall, wonderful."
32015,"Very fun - thought-provoking through nonstop laughing; This is a very funny movie - although like all good satire it is also a sharp and biting indictment of social ills - in this case narrow-minded religiosity and hypocrisy. The rollicking pace and continual surprises make it very entertaining; the content of the satire sticks, giving a memorable message. The characters are both archetypal and hilariously believable, the acting terrific. The outrageous plot sweeps one right along for the enormous fun of it all, but in the middle of the hilarity the brain keeps registering that this is really an extremely intelligent and imaginative piece of social commentary, telling very important truths while being extravagantly entertaining. **********"
50630,"A beautiful film; I saw this film at an advance screening. Jeremy (Joshua Jackson) works for a publisher in London and dreams of being a writer. When he is sent to a small village in Tuscany to find Weldon Parish (Harvey Keitel) a reclusive writer who has stopped writing, his life is forever changed. What follows is a funny and heart-warming story of two men and their journey to overcome their fears. Keitel and Jackson are wonderful in their roles. I was not quite sure what to expect from Jackson having only seen him play teenage roles before, but he shows that he can hold his ground and carry and film on his own. While there Jeremy meets Weldon's daughter Isabella, played by the stunningly beautiful Claire Forlani and soon the two of them fall in love. Another star of this film is it's locations. They are absolutely breath-taking. If anyone knows the name of the village they filmed in I would love to know. The director lets the actors do their job without obtrusive camera moves. In my opinion there are too few movies like this made today. There is no action here, just real characters, with real problems. This is a movie about dreams and having the courage and faith to follow them. A Beautiful, beautiful movie."
32015,"Absolutely hilarious; I wasn't sure what to expect. Turns out it has everything and more. From the first scene to the last, it was witty, thought provoking and really touched on many of today's ""hot"" issues. Homosexuality, racism, religion, and fantasy, just to name a few. My favorite scene was with Birdie Mae, the church lady! Sue Cochran rocks with her flare for dare, and brings a touch of Seattle's attitude to the big screen. Angie Louise, as usual, is priceless as the token female Jesus. Take a ""bite"" out of your day to see Gory Gory. And don't forget the popcorn, you'll be ""goolishly"" pleased. Definitely a must see. Another movie destined to be a classic, right up there with Rocky Horror."
32015,"Tongue-in-Groovy Send-Up of All Things Zombified...; If you like your horror drenched in black satire, 80s'-flecked acid-trippy, and offensive to everyone, this one's for you. I recently viewed and reviewed the DVD for a French Film Mag ""L'Ecran Fantastique"" and had a blast following the ridiculous and sublime send-up to the horror genre with a nod to the hippie dippy past...What can you say about a redemptive, spiritually based can-do group of thespian friends eager to do the right thing for the good of Mankind who ends up having to reckon with a small town up in arms and supposedly gunning for Satan? This is for die-hard fans of zombie parody, Peter Max-inspired graphics out-there bad wigs, over-the-top costumes and funny as all get out.... Lotsa fun. Lotsa laugh. Lotsa Gore. Enjoy!"
32015,"So Damn Funny; For a good time cry out GORY GORY HALLELUJAH! At times i laughed so hard I almost wet my pants. This is a must see!!!! It is a very intelligent comedy for those with a twisted sense of humor. Do you like Bruce Campbell, are you a fan of John Waters, do you own a copy of Faster Pussy Cat Kill Kill? Than this is for you, make a point to see this movie. You will not be disappointed. I promise. The Von Piglet sisters have outdone themselves this time. The creative efforts of Ms. Corcoran and Ms. Louise are both witty and a little kooky. These two women have brought their vision to the ""silver screen"" for all of us to enjoy, and I hope any and all who read this do just that."
135015,"Naples at its best; In the greatest city of the world someone wants to steal the San Gennaro's treasure. Dudu (Nino Manfredi) boss of ""La Sanità"" (a popular quarter of Naples) is taking time to make the right choice: can they succeed? is it really a great occasion? will San Gennaro be happy? The comedy let us understand lot of things about the city of Naples and its habits: superstitious practices, amazing people (like ""the baron"": the only man who has the heart on the right) and their passion for music (the Festival of Neapolitan song, and the great singer Sergio Bruni, he always wants to be the last to sing)... And TOTO', playing the role of DON VINCENZO IL FENOMENO: a genius."
73639,"a Transylvanian family moves to the Wild West; I am a big western fan, and while I was browsing IMDb's western category, I bumped into this movie. It was a pleasant surprise, brings me pleasant memories when thinking, I saw this movie many years ago. First of all, the title: The artist (female), the Dollars and Ardelenii(people living in Transylvania). The movie is part of a mini-series of 3 (if I remember correctly). The other two titles I know are The artist, the Oil and Ardelenii and The artist, the Little Baby and Ardelenii. All three movies are about a Transylvanian family, which is looking for a better life, and goes to conquer the American Wild West. If you are not a Romanian, you will also enjoy this movie (a western comedy) not only about some tough people from Ardeal (Transylvania)wich shivers the west, but you will also find out about Transylvanian habits and traditions (I will never forget the oldest of the brothers, who is the leader of the clan, who always slaps the youngest telling him to shut up because he's stupid and young) I don't want to tell you more, part because I don't want to spoil your pleasure, part because I don't remember, but if you can put your hands on any of those three movies, don't hesitate, you will enjoy."
27706,"Less than the sum of its parts; The wife and I went to see Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events at the Kenrick Theater Saturday. We both agreed to check it out, using some gift certificates I've been hoarding since my birthday. Unfortunate Events details a slice out of the life of three orphans whose parents perished in a tragic fire. The children are placed in the care of Count Olaf, played by Jim Carey  weirdness ensues. The Baudelaire Orphans, as the narrator refers to them often, are themselves exceptional. Emily Browning plays Violet, and captures a winsome mix of plucky and vulnerable. Violet is clever and inventive, cobbling together contrivances and developing solutions to their perils. Liam Aiken is Klaus, who ably portrays the younger brainy brother whose voracious appetite for learning provides impetus for Violet's inventiveness. Sunny is an adorable toddler whose contribution is her ability to bite (and be otherwise amazingly well-behaved). The movie is surreal and incongruent, which is to be expected. The settings are Victorian, like turn of the century England. Most of the adults have mannerisms that we associate with England, but everyone is American. It's a little odd. Piled onto this oddness is the ick factor of watching children being pursued by a murderous villain. As funny as Carey makes Olaf, the fact is that the man ends up attempting dreadful things, actions that would land any child in therapy for years. On the other hand, it is rewarding to see children be tough and work to overcome their problems rather than curl up and suffer slings and arrows. The adults in their lives are at best negligent idiots. Against outrageous circumstances the trio stand, surviving by their wits, will and cooperation. The visuals are a real treat, particularly if you like the Victorian era. The set pieces and props show tremendous attention to creating a world that resembles something we are familiar with, but is distorted enough to take the edge off the truly awful nature of the unfortunate events of the movie's title. Jim Carey absolutely chews up the screen. As part of the plot he adopts several personas, and he completely owns his scenes. I would say that the weakness of the movie is the strength of Carey's performance. We have a natural sympathy toward the orphans, and while they do good work capturing the essence of enterprise, Carey's antics are so overwhelming that the movie becomes too much about his character, and we just don't like him. That said, the film has funny moments. Irrational fears about household items turn out to not be so irrational after all, and Dustin Hoffman makes a cameo appearance that is amusing and inexplicably brief. In summary, Lemony Snicket's 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' is an enjoyable but flawed movie. The visuals are excellent as are the performances of the protagonists. Carey is at his rubber-bodied best, but that ends up distracting. The film has a dark theme, but not one a kid over eight couldn't deal with."
6618,"Bravo; To use soccer as a vehicle to spread kung fu to the masses.Perhaps only Mr Stephen Chow Sing Chi could come up with that.It was no surprise that this movie became a huge sensation all across Asia(could have been the world,thanks to miramax).Like all other Sing-yeh's films,this movie really hurt my stomach from the laughter,but it was not only the humor that made me love it so much,in fact,it was the way he executes the movie that makes it a masterpiece.Never before have I ever seen a HK movie so well balanced between action and comedy,and after watching Kung Fu Hustle(his next movie),I was afraid that even he himself could no longer reach the high standard achieved by this film.Shaolin Soccer wasn't just a great movie;it developed my love for kung fu(seriously).Overall,you are bound to love this film,whether you're a soccer fan or not. P.S:I've watched it 12 times already,as of now."
1204,"The Best Epic and Movie of the 20th Century; From the cinematography, the acting, the story, the characters, the action and the overall atmoshpere of Lawrence of Arabia we witness brilliance in film making. Ben-Hur is an extraordinary film, but this is the pinnacle of expert movie-making. Peter O'toole gives one of the most intense performances of the century and all of the supporting actors are first-rate. What is most commendable about Lawrence of Arabia is that it is a brilliant piece of film without the pretense of most modern films. The story and the actors are the key elements; there is no ""epiphanic"" or ""relevatory"" moment--that spoil so many current movies--that change the story from its true telling. If you want to watch film-making at its finest, watch this movie. It's four hours long, but you will not be disappointed."
121951,"Overlooked film; Walk a Crooked Mile was filmed almost entirely on location. FBI agent Dan O'Hara (Dennis O'Keefe) and Scotland Yard operative Philip Grayson (Louis Hayward) team up to investigate a security leak at a Southern California atomic plant. The investigation takes place in San Francisco, where a communist spy ring flourishes. Actors as Raymond Burr and Philip Van Zandt play the communist agents. The documentary technique gives a factual gloss to the melodramatic format. Action moves back and forth between San Francisco and the atomic plant in southern California. Gordon Douglas' knowledgeable directing keeps the film moving forward. He manages to build suspense through misdirection. The method used to take information out of the atomic plant is well protected thus keeping you guessing. The movie is typical 40s and early 50s film noir."
6950,"something...missing; James Horner, I have only one thing to say to you...stop cannibalizing scores from your other films because you're too lazy to compose an entirely new soundtrack! You did it in Mask of Zorro, stealing whole parts of the Willow soundtrack. Now, in The Missing, you put in large parts of The mask of Zorro, which was stolen from Willow in the first place! How many times are you going to retread the same old pipe music? Do you think that people are too stupid to notice?! That aside, this movie didn't quite gel for me. It wanted to be too many things, and wasn't enough of any of them. To start with, I saw very little emotion between Cate Blanchett's healer 'Maggie', and her restless and frivolous daughter Evan Racher Wood 'Lily'. More, Cate didn't seem as unsettled by her father's (Tommy Lee Jones) reappearance as she should have been, considering the fact that he'd run out on her and her mother many years ago. But then, everything in the film has a rather gray, listless cast to it. It's pretty scenery, but that's about it. I didn't sympathize much with Lily when she was taken by the renegade Apaches to be sold down in Mexico, because I sincerely didn't like her. And twice during the film, she could've gotten away. Once, she could have left by herself. But instead, she unties the crazed mother with the dead child, then gives the woman a gun! The woman promptly shoots herself, and Lily is recaptured. I was gritting my teeth by then. And then, when the Apache comes to rescue his daughter-in-law and Lily, she screams because she sees the cross he's carrying, that her mother had given to him so that she'd know he was trustworthy! He promptly gets killed by the kidnappers, and Lily and the Apache girl are recaptured. I wanted to shoot the girl myself by then. She was so annoying and stupid that the whole rescue party didn't seem worthwhile. There are a lot of gruesome scenes that seem to have been thrown in just to convince you that this is a 'serious' and 'gritty' film. They're mostly gratuitous and just take up too much time that could be spent forwarding the plot. And the Brujo, or witch, isn't terribly frightening-Howard seemed to think that horribly scarring and pitting his face would make up for the fact that his personality just doesn't seem twisted or frightening enough. All of the characters seem half asleep, running on empty. And one thing I found really disturbing was how much weight Cate Blanchett has lost. She looked like an animated stick figure in her clothes, with her cheekbones jutting out under her skin. Maybe the Brujo put a curse on her like the one in Thinner?"
8981,best movie; This is the best movie i've seen in ages and i love Julia Roberts and all of the actor's in this film. The plot and overall themes throughout the movie are really interesting and it's a different movie. Jude Law and Clive Owen are also excellent in the film and add character's not seen in many of the movies of today. The twists in the film also add levels of interest and Natalie port man's beauty shines through with her stunning and captivating performance. I really recommend this film to anyone looking for a interesting and unpredictable love story with new and captivating performances. You've also gotta love the song at the start and overall this movie was excellent.
133089,"7 Blood-Stained stars (out of 10); A killer with black gloves is murdering women and leaving silver crescent moon emblems on their bodies in this Umberto Lenzi directed film, which is quite a good deal easier to follow then his later made ""Spasmo"". Mr. Lenzi was never in the same league as, say Dario Argento or even Sergio Martino, but for me this film of his came the closest to either of them. The acting is good, although the DVD-version that I own sadly doesn't contain a sub-titled original language version. That's the only grip that I can think of right now. If you love the giallo sub-genre like I, you would do yourself well by seeing this one. My Grade: B- DVD Extras: Gabriella Giorgelli; Interview with Umberto Lenzi; liner notes; Art Gallery; Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for ""Eaten Alive"" and ""Spasmo"" Eye Candy: Gabriella Giorgelli's mammoth melons get unleashed; Marina Malfatti does the same but pales in comparison; and a few hippie extras"
31221,"Daring but definitely not Daredevil!!; What a great movie - even my wife liked it. Jennifer Garner is still good at emoting anguish (a la alias)and at looking and acting like an assassin. That red outfit - she wears it well. There is one funny thing - when I tell people how good it was many say they heard it was bad. Some reviewers must be looking for ""The Hours"" or ""War and Peace"", which this is not. It is an excellent effort at bringing a comic book hero to the big screen and I think Jennifer Garner was a perfect choice. Kirsten Prout is also good as the budding ""treasure"". Overall, the bad guys are very bad and the special effects used well to achieve their powers. The director really had a good eye for stylish effects and some of the fight sequences are really very impressive. This is not just another kick-boxing movie and rises miles above Daredevil. I gave this a 10 and hope that future attempts at comic book conversion strive for this level of excellence."
8667,"good, but not impressive; I recently saw ""a home at the end of the world"" manly because of the well publicized ""controversy"" that I heard about during the summer. When I finally saw this film,I really could'nt see what all the fuss was about. This movie is good, but it certainly isn't ""one the year's best"" as roger ebert put it. (go see kinsy, million dollar baby, hotel rwanda, kill bill 2 etc.) I was impressed with robin wright penn's performance and dallas roberts is great, but Colin Farrell's doe eyed, earnest performance really fell flat for me. He got major kudos for playing against his hell raiser off screen persona, but for me, playing against type isn't enough for a great performance. I love Colin Farrell (i really do!) and he's given amazing performances in other films (tigerland,phone booth,intermisson) but not here. The film it self falls flat in a way (though not completely) because of the way it handles time. You don't really get a sense of these characters and the world they live in because its too sketchy. I may be wrong because I'm not a film scholar. I guess the major reason this film got so much press was the fact that Farrell's so called ""distracting"" member caused an audience of idiots to go blind and ""forget the plot"" of this incredibly plot less film. After seeing this film, I doubt such an appearance would have really caused a distraction. What's really distracting was that awful hippie wig Farrell was wearing Wheeeeew! But in all, this film isn't really that bad. Hopefully they'll come out with a special DVD and included other possibly distracting material."
31221,"saw it and it was great!; I was surprised ""Abby"" got so much action, I wanted to see elektra invincible, not just an average superhero. But otherwise, it was great!! I'm also a jennifer garner fan from Alias and it was so much like alias with the martial arts. Her axe and push kicks just are so intense in this movie. You can feel the effects. I really hope there is an Elektra 2 because she needs to be better and everyone wants to see her better than her matchup, not have Abby give her time to catch her breath to go in for the kill. Also hope to see more of her supernatural powers. We saw plenty for the bad guys, though. The effects were great! Better than great! Tattoo was such a great character."
128560,"The classic of classics; Many people call this the best of the ""Jonsson gang"" movies. In my opinion it is sure one of the best there is. You start on the island of Mallorca and of course Harry and Vanheden is trying to make a living not selling stuff but scamming people, as usual. On the other hand Birgitta Andersson, also known as Doris is trying to make a living with her solarium, called Dorisol. Of course Charles Ingvar, also known as sickan is introduced to the story short after the beginning. Sickan gets a ""job"" offer by non other then Wall Enberg and off he is, to Mallorca. I wont spoil anything for you but, of course it is about stealing something that has a great value. And there is a twist, you never end up empty handed, if you are a part of Jonsson gang. My vote 7/10 Its a classic!"
31221,"my comment on Elektra; when i first saw Daredevil. i was amazed of how well jennifer garner fought and stuff. She was also pretty in that movie. I love daredevil, but most of all i watched Elektra yesterday and man to me that movie is the BOMB. i loved it..when its because I'm a huge fan of jennifer garner and i would love to meet her someday, but i really liked the movie. if i watched it again i would still love it. i don't think i would get tired of it. except the part where she gets kissed by the gyrl. it was kinda like AHHH at first, but it makes sense..so yea. everyone who has not seen Elektra..GO SEE IT! i don't know about all you guys but I LOVED IT AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE IT!!"
3739,"Exquisite; Beautiful, spellbinding romantic comedy with a suave jewel thief (Herbert Marshall) falling in love with his intended victim (luminous Kay Francis) much to the displeasure of his girlfriend (Miriam Hopkins).  Beautifully shot (the scenes seem to glow), incredible sets and costumes, a very witty script, wonderful performances by everybody, superb direction by Ernst Lubitsch and some fairly racy Pre-Code material.  What more can I say? It's perfection.  A must-see!"
33124,"No one moved; Today I watched Napola. The movie is quite frightening and shocking. You get the feeling at first that this is a film about a friendship or a school. It isn't. Its a film about cruel intentions, and boys who are to be made mad. It's not a great film but one you should have seen and think about. And every time you must ask the same question: ""Had I been so much different from these boys in their uniforms?"" When the Movie was about to end and the credits showed up, no one in the Cinema was moving. No one was whispering. No one was talking. About two minutes the whole audience sat there in silence. That was at last more frightening than the whole motion picture."
3949,"a downward spiral...; ...into hell. this movie tugs at humanity's chords and never lets go. a brutal and bumpy ride filled with views of the deepest recesses of pain, suffering, addition and neglect. if you're a status quo movie viewer enthralled by 'armageddon', 'independence day' or any jerry bruckheimer or michael bay films, i would forego this one. classic American movie clichés are thrown out the window--no happy endings, no feel good moments, no artificial emotion. what you have here is a pessimistic journey of addiction by characters all addicted to their own drug, be it TV, narcotics or diet pills. to mortals, they're all the same, and cause catastrophic destruction and ruined lives. the last half hour of this film--where the rush down the spiral truly begins--is to your psyche as the first half hour of 'saving private ryan' was to your senses; it will blow you away and leave you languishing and worn out. as another reviewer mentioned, this to me is also one of the most powerful, invigorating and disturbing films i have ever seen--truly cathartic. and i'm no weakling--i eat dinner while watching the surgery channel and laughed when private pyle blew his brains out in 'full metal jacket', so to say that a movie left me with my jaw wide open and the hair on the back of my neck standing is not an overstatement. alas, it may leave you jaded for more invigorating stuff to come out of Hollywood. unfortunately, it would never happen. the only mainstream filmmaker to even come close to this much pathos was kubrick, and he's gone (RIP). but cheer on maverick filmmakers, such as aronofsky, and keep the good stuff coming. also, i recommend staying away from blockbuster if you go out to rent this video; they only carry the R-rated version, not the original NC-17 version."
133943,"Mankillers - A Must See!; I found this video on a carboot for 50p. The special effects must have cost little more than this, you can create better special effects at home using those those ""rio snap"" things from when i was a kid, you know the ones that you throw at the ground and they make a small bang. The girls are supposed to be like supermodels but don't even come close. I love this film exactly for these reasons, it is pure low budget cheese! however it still beats higher budget films such as TAXI, the one based on crazy taxi with ""queen latifa"" which is the worst film i have ever seen in my life!! If you ever see this film for sale on a carboot sale or market buy this film! It will bring you hours of enjoyment :)"
107410,"The best ever movie (in my opinion); I was a schoolboy when I watched this film for the first time. The next day I knew that all pupils of our form watched it and all were fascinated by the film as I was. I think the same situation was in all forms of our school and in the whole Soviet Union. Later I watched it every time it was shown on TV and want to watch more. I think that comparison with ""Back to the Future"" or other Sci-Fi films is not appropriate. ""Gost'ya iz budushchego"" is unique in many ways, once you have watched it, you never forget it. This film is full of belief in peaceful science achievements, full of belief in the beautiful future of our world. It's not only the film, but also a forecast of many scientific inventions and achievements. The time shown in the film is the year 1984 (the year of its creation) and the year 2084 (where a schoolboy Kolya Gerasimov has traveled for some time and where his friend Alisa Seleznyova was from). The year now is 2005, many inventions and achievements predicted in the film are not realized yet. Such as ""Mielophone"" (a device, which can read thoughts of any animal and human), expeditions to Venus and Mars (as easy as going for a picnic in the weekend), creating and launching of the satellites as a homework for pupils, easy to drive flying machines (which completely replaced automobiles), biorobots, ""historical identification"" of any kind of material or creature performed in a couple of minutes, and many others. Meanwhile, some of them nowadays became much more realistic than they seemed in 1984! Just wait for 2084 :-) The film also depicts typical Russian schoolboys and schoolgirls (and does it so naturally!). With their inventiveness, curiosity, humour, dreaminess. Look for example at Fima Korolyov, you could find such character in nearly all forms of every school of the Soviet Union, similar character was in my form too! Alisa Seleznyova... I myself, as well as many my classmates fell in love at first sight with her! By the way, later an actress who played Alisa became a scientist - I think she was as much influenced by the film as people who watched it on TV. Beautiful idea, beautiful realization, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song ""Prekrasnoye Daleko"" (""The Wonderful Far-Away"")... Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful... The last thing I want to say is that different remakes and ""new versions"" of the song from the film and even the film itself were made later and spread on TV and in the Internet. All they are not even comparable with the original. I should not even comment them, my comment is only about the original. So, request the original and enjoy it!"
27869,"One of the best! War movies ever made!; Damn what i got surprised of this one.. i didn't have much of expectation of this movie, korean, foreign film maby B film etc.. but definitively so was'nt my opinion, great war scenes with superb effects, good story and for sure this movie can be compare with saving private ryan, i think they are in same class. The story is about a young boy who is 18 forced to do military duty and about his older brother who join the military just for watching over his brother so he can find him a way out from the hell. No more to tell, watch the movie and get the full story you selves.. absolutely the best foreign (non Hollywood etc.) war movie ever made! rate: 10/10"
2692,"A nice roller-coaster ride of a movie...; I watched this film without any prior knowledge of what it was about. I only knew a little bit from the synopsis on the back of the DVD case, and I must say that this is one cool movie. Cool is a very vague way to review a movie so let me elaborate a bit. The movie's plot is just so so. You really don't get to know much of anything about the characters, and the movie is fairly short anyways(around 80 mins.). The summary of the plot is Lola's boyfriend Manni was supposed to transport 100,000 Marks to a local gangster(Ronnie), but he loses the money. So as a last chance, he calls Lola and informs her that in twenty minutes he needs the 100,000 or he's a goner. Thus begins the roller-coaster ride. If you liked how that sounded, then by all means you should check this movie out! Now What you DO get though is a techno score through out the whole film(most of it anyways) that keeps the movie zipping along at a quick pace. I kept on noticing how the movement on the film would quite often synch up with the music score which was very nice. I've never been a fan of techno, but it really fit this movie well and, in my opinion, is a major contributing factor that makes this movie so ""cool"". The camera work is also excellently done. Lots of different camera angles that you usually don't see in films. All in all, if you're running short on movies to watch, or just want to see something different then by all means check this out!"
30905,"Unrealistic...; I went into this movie thinking it would be a non-cliché, modern portrayal of graffiti culture in NY... only to see in the first 2 minutes, a guy Break dancing with a boombox, in front of a muraled wall. Maybe it was a flashback of the main character as a kid... but it seems that would only make sense if the lead character was 30yrs old. I tried to give this movie a chance. But there were just too many things that bugged me... The writing for instance, all the graffiti terminology was incorrectly used. When a graffiti writer goes ""Bombing"" he does not go out and do full illegal murals. Nobody even mentions doing ""fill-ins"" or ""throwups"" which are the most commonly used terms/acts by graf-writers. They call them ""pieces"" in the movie, which is completely wrong. Those are just some examples... It became pretty obvious that the filmmakers knew little or Nothing about graffiti. Just because you know about Sane & Smith, and heard a couple chase stories from your NYU buddy, isn't enough to go out and make a significant Graffiti movie. There is some ""cool"" cinematography in this, which isn't bad. But that's it. Storyline is similar to the likes of Wild Style or Beat Street (a hip hop love story). But even those movies were made with less pretension than this."
318,"The Power of Hope; I have to give this Film Credit, Defiently when credit is due. This Was an outstanding film. The history of this film was that it actually was taken off of short story from Steven king. and as I'm not a great fan of Steven King. I would say this movie is like a Flower that grown out of dirt. The Story is about a man. and the power that hope can achieve. In jail he accomplished things and hardships no man should suffer. he triumph in goals and achieves without deferring. and he never gave up hope. It took us on a roller-coaster and in the end it showed us that miracles can blossom where you would never expect it. It was a beautiful and it deserved a lot more then it ever got."
8904,"Jack-o, oh Jack-o; *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* I bought this video for three bucks. My brother had told me about this one because he had actually met Jack-O. Yes, the dude in the pumpkin mask. B-movie giants walk amongst us. I had to behold the cinematic genius that was ""Jack-O"" so I could live vicariously through my brother. I can honestly say that ""Jack-O"" went exactly like I thought it would. There was not one thing that surprised me about this flick. Well, that's not completely true. I was surprised to see Linnea Quigley in this one. And everybody can relax, she does take a shower. Quigley and showers. Peanut butter and Jelly. So Jack-O comes back from the dead to kill a stoic boy for some reason or another. You'd think that the kid would get a little emotional about a pumpkin man trying to carve him up. Would a scream kill him now and then? Anyway, Quigley babysits him and Pumpkinhead trashes the party. ""Jack-O"" follows the B-movie playbook step by step. Blood, breasts, bad acting, repeat. If you're a B-movie fan, you'll find something to like."
1983,"Already falling into tedium; When it comes to keeping a consistent plot the Halloween series has been the absolute worst. 1 and 2 follow each other okay, 3 is the joker in the pack, Return, Revenge and Curse were nothing but gibberish and H20 and Resurrection have been poor 'post-modern' exercises in convention merely using the Halloween name. Right after the original Halloween ended, Laurie is taken away to get stitched up, but Michael Myers ain't quite dead yet. Much of this bore is set in a hospital as he very, very slowly goes about his killing machine business. Donald Pleasence does his mad doctor bit again spouting some crackpot dialogue in a strange, offbeat way. No one listens to him, of course and they end up dead. It's an okay sequel but it's marred by unbearable slowness. The pace for that particular night was already set by the first film so why slow down and build up again? Regarded as a classic far too often the first film is somewhat obsolete today. But it does have one purpose: to always look good when compared to the drek of 'horror' we suffer today. This first sequel, coming a mere three years after the original, already looks tired and the thin premise is stretched to breaking point. There's no purity or class here. Plus it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. What happened to Jimmy? He died by gently banging his head but didn't keel over until 20 minutes later? What? Why do the credits list someone playing Michael Myers (Age 23) when he is only 21 in the film and is played by Dick Warlock? Why did he kill the Sheriff's daughter (which he does again in Revenge)? This new DVD from Universal improves upon the cruddy Goodtimes release by giving us a new 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a sturdy keepcase instead of a horrid snapper. The sound is in not-bad-for-its-day Dolby Stereo. There are no features to speak of, which is annoying since Universal originally promised us commentaries, documentaries, deleted scenes etc. Pick it up cheap."
6596,"Speechless. Bewildered. Angry.; Having seen this film, my first sensation was that of total blankness. Then came a sense of bewilderment, soon followed by anger. What does this film want to say? What message does it want to convey? What was the story about, actually? The plot is, if it exists, complex, incomprehensible, juvenile and messy. The director seems to want to weave the characters destinies together, but fails miserably, causing the viewer to feel bereft of any useful information necessary to understand anything of the story. The acting is not bad, but that doesn't help to keep this utter garbage above surface. Watching this is two hours of your life that you will never get back. Avoid it at all costs."
127865,"Special Agent Gargoyle at your service; *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* The CIA has their hands full with a high profile kidnapping. Special Agent Gargoyle comes to the rescue. Anytime there was any trouble, a shootout on a rooftop for example, the Gargoyle would swoop down in the nick of time. He was a very patriotic monster. Here to serve. And eat lots of people. Soon the CIA will hunt it down as priests and Gargoyles do battle over the fate of the entire world. Exciting eh? ""Gargoyles"" is a B-movie all the way. It throws in all the clichés it can. Car chases, spies, shootouts and a large computer generated Gargoyle. As these things go, ""Gargoyles"" wasn't too bad. It didn't make me want to kill myself. So that's a good thing. I was a little surprised that there wasn't any nudity. One of the CIA agents was a babe as was another doctor character. Agent Babe and Dr. Hot stuff. Clearly, this was the one B-movie element that was missing. The Gargoyle was flying around buck naked but it wasn't as satisfying."
4509,"The Great Outdoors!; The Great Outdoors is excellent comedy with a great cast which includes Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Stephanie Faracy, Annette Bening, Robert Prosky, and John Bloom! The acting by all of these actors is very good. Aykroyd has a great performance and Candy is really wonderful in the movie. Faracy and Bening are also very good. I think that Candy and Faracy were excellent together as a couple. The music by Thomas Newman is good. The film is very exciting and its just so hilarious the entire time. This really is great comedy and in My opinion its a classic! If you love John Candy, Dan Aykroyd, and the rest of the cast mentioned and great comedies then I Strongly recommend this film! Movie Nuttball's NOTE: If you love John Candy then I recommend that you see the following films: Summer Rental, Armed and Dangerous, Spaceballs, Who's Harry Crumb?, and Uncle Buck!"
4386,"Cats and Dogs!; Cats and Dogs is a great comedy action film that stars Jeff Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins, Alexander Pollock, Miriam Margolyes, Tobey Maguire, Alec Baldwin, Sean Hayes, Susan Sarandon, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jon Lovitz, Joe Pantoliano, and Charlton Heston! There are several hilarious moments in this picture. The action scenes are done very well. Goldblum and the other actors were. The castle scenes were really cool. The music by John Debney is very good. The movie is totally funny. I thought it was something else seeing all those different types of dogs and cats. So if you who like Jeff Goldblum and the rest of the cast mentioned and comedies with animals then I strongly recommend this film!"
7492,"Interesting Little Gem From Romero; This was an interesting little gem from Romero, it's not your typical vampire film, and it was rather slow paced but still very engaging, and i liked all the characters. However the ending was a little abrupt, and a couple of the characters could have been developed more, i so wanted to learn more about Christina and Tada Cuta. The Direction is excellent!. it had some great camera angles, the pace was good and overall he did a solid job nothing fancy but Romero is one of the best directors of all time in my opinion. (see The Dead Trilogy) for outstanding direction) still the direction was still great here. There was a fair amount of blood. we get a few bloody gunshot wounds, plenty of blood sucking, slit wrists, bloody animal gore (hated it), bloody corpse in the bathtub, and a stake to the heart (very bloody). The Acting is great!. What a find John Amplas was he is awesome here , i really liked his character and found him very interesting he rocked!, where is he now?.Lincoln Maazel does very well here , rather unlikable at times but a very cool character. Christine Forrest is cute and does well here and wish she had more screen time. Tom Savini always rocks and was good when on screen. George Romero is actually okay as Father Howard. Overall this is well worth checking out see it. *** out of 5"
3992,"A masterpiece...; I do not understand Italian, but I don't have any problem understanding good cinema and that is what Malena is. A honest movie about a beautiful lady, an attempt to show the Fascist face of Italy in the times of World war, told by a boy of 12 years. Where the movie scores is the way the story is told and the way they have shown the hardships a lady has to undergo, just because she is beautiful and does not have a Husband is excellent. On the acting front, Monica really does not have a lot to do, because she is mostly seen as a fantasy element by everyone in the movie, which she is not. The boy is excellent, his dad is hilarious and his friends are awesome. In certain parts the movie makes you laugh, but at times it also make you think. The final word: A movie that has all elements of a classic, and is a must watch for all who believe in watching movie as if a story is being told. I rate it very high... give it 10/10."
8861,"yep, this film heralds the apocalypse all right..of Holly wood; Oh man. Where to start? In the first place, I rather liked the first Resident Evil. I rented it to have good laugh, and found myself enjoying it far more than I expected to. Which makes this crass, awful sequel an even worse disappointment for me. From start to finish, this movie was just painfully dreadful. My biggest complaint, besides the so-called 'plot' and the horrible fight scenes, are the characters. The female ex-cop was such an annoying, grating person that I was praying to every God in the universe that she be mutilated in the most painful way possible. But no...Now we'll have to sit through yet another sequel with her in it, and watch her laughable attempts at acting. And maybe she'll stalk around in ten inch high heels and another tight, hard to move in outfit that a whore would be proud of wearing. That'd be great, huh? Odod Fehr is usually a pretty good actor. It took me at least twenty minutes just to RECOGNIZE him in this film! And his cop had all the personality of tofu. Not so his 'russian' partner, being hilariously overacted by Zach Ward, who I best remember as the stoner younger brother off the Fox sitcom Titus. The whiny reporter wasn't an asset to the cast, but then no one was except for the comic relief, a stereotypical black criminal dressed like a pimp and with gold plated guns. He's a hoot as he flees through the city trying to get out, stopping for a moment to ogle some dead, topless strippers. The Alice character isn't bad, although some of her powers seem a little overdone. She's superwoman, right , we got it. I have a lot of niggling questions about what little plot that there was. For one thing-in the graveyard, the dead were rising from their graves to attack the fleeing group. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the virus only works on people who've been dead for no more than a month or so. It revives dead cells which still carry traces of electrical charge, which the body still does for about six weeks or so. So how can half rotted corpses like the one with worms crawling out of its skull still come to life and attack them? That corpse was probably over a year old. Perhaps its foolish of me to think that the movie should have internal integrity and coherence, but one can hope, right? My brother-in-law was laughing over the scene in the church where Alice rides a motorcycle through the doors, flips off of it so that it crushes the uber beast, and then shoots the bike so that it explodes. Did she stick a grenade in the gas tank first? Maybe the creature had exploding boogers? Who knows. The fight on the rooftop between Alice and Nemesis was just the height of lame. And the death of Nemesis-death by helicopter-just left me roaring with laughter. And shaking my head, as well. Honestly, they couldn't have come up with something better? Not really, I guess, if you consider the lame dialog, bad acting, and stupid action scenes that proliferate in this film. You're left scratching your head more often than not, wondering if the screenwriter and director had both stayed up together sucking down a giant bong hit, and then decided to make a movie while still stoned out of their minds. My theory is that they spent their entire budget on the cool trailer, and didn't have enough left to put together a decent movie. Either that, or the director shot the entire film without looking at it."
27754,"Great; Great, I really enjoy this film the plot line was really genuine and the acting was good. Foolproof is about two guys and a girl starting Rayan Reynolds from ""Two Guys a Girl and a Pizza Place"" ironically enough, who plan heist to rob jewelry stores and bypass their security systems but never actually go through with the plan its just for fun, or so they thought. Every thing was great until one of their plans gets stolen and the robbery actually takes place, now with all the evidence pointing to them they are approached by the guy who stole the file telling them that they have to due a job for him or he will turn the papers with their finger prints all over them to the police, whats one to due? Foolproof a great heist type movie good on the chills, action and every now and again comedy, over all you cant miss this one."
107161,"Explosive final scene with fireworks and lightning slashes of the cane sword; This is a solid entry in the series. It's true that there is little action until the closing minutes, but when the dam breaks, it breaks big! I very much appreciated the portrayal of the two bosses. In many Zatoichi films all bosses are equally bad and sometimes disgusting in their greed and avarice. In this film Zatoichi winds up in the house of boss Bunkichi. Bunkichi turns out to be the real deal. He avoids confrontation, does not exploit the locals, and even puts on a fireworks display during O-Bon (summer festival). Zatoichi respects Bunkichi's household and the values they stand for. In contract, the boss on the other side of the river is Yasugoro. The actor who plays Yasugoro shows up in many of the films in the series. Here he does a great job as the bad guy, strutting around when he is safe and stuttering with nervousness whenever things get rough. And while the fireworks go off overhead, Zatoichi crosses the river to make Yasugoro pay for his crimes. The lighting in the last fight scene is menacing. Ichi wreaks bloody vengeance in a systematic and frightening manner. As the last firework explodes overhead, Zatoichi delivers the final devastating blow."
30892,"Whose little girl are you?; THIS REVIEW CONTAINS CONTENT WHICH SOME READERS MAY FIND SEXUALLY DISTRESSING. Henry Darger (1892-1973) remains the most startling exemplar of 'outsider art': art created by an individual who has absolutely no contact with the formal art world. Darger, a native of Chicago, suffered an extremely abusive childhood ... in which he was institutionalised in an asylum for feeble-minded children, even though he may have been of above-average intelligence. He spent almost his entire adult life as a janitor in a Catholic hospital, never earning more than $25 weekly. During these decades, he obsessively attended Mass thrice daily (four times on the Sunday) and typed a 15,000-page novel which nobody has read in its entirety. (I've read four pages of the impenetrable typescript which resides at the American Museum of Folk Art: that's all I could manage.) What has brought Darger so much posthumous attention is his artwork: obsessive drawings of little girls, brightly coloured, on long sheets of butcher's paper. Many of Darger's girls (traced from better artists' work) wear elaborate frocks. Others, drawn free-hand by Darger, have bizarre animal appendages: butterfly wings, rams' horns. Speaking of appendages: many of these little girls are naked ... and they have little-boy penises. Darger's murals and his multi-volume novel document a fantasy realm in which heroic little Christian girls are eternally at war with pagan soldiers. Jessica Yu's documentary 'In the Realms of the Unreal' (a shortened version of the title of Darger's novel) attempts to make sense of Darger's life, art and obsessions. Darger was not precisely a recluse: he appeared in public but interacted very little. Because Yu has no footage of Darger, and only a handful of photographs of him, she resorts to re-enactments. We keep hearing a male voice-over that purports to be Darger, speaking about himself. Only in the end credits do we learn that this is an actor (Larry Pine), reading fictionalised narration scripted by Yu. The immensely talented child actress Dakota Fanning also narrates: the decision to use a little girl for this task is exactly right, and Fanning reads her material splendidly ... but Yu has written text for her which sounds improbably mature from such a young narrator. Yu interviews a surprisingly large number of the very few people who actually knew Darger. (They disagree on how to pronounce his name.) I agree with the interviewee who theorises that Darger drew penises on his little girls because he was entirely innocent (and ignorant) of the female anatomy, and he sincerely believed that little girls' sexual equipment looked like little boys'. Many of the little girls in Darger's art (and in his novel) are tortured or brutally murdered by men in military uniforms with mortarboard hats, yet it's clear that Darger's sympathies are with the little girls. He seems to be repelled, not aroused by the violence which he fictionally inflicts on them. I thought I knew all the weird stories about Darger, but this documentary springs a new one. Apparently, when Darger was alone in his bedsit, he was overheard through the walls by his landlords and the other boarders: having loud arguments with himself, speaking in different voices and accents, sometimes in unknown languages. It wouldn't surprise me if Darger had multiple personalities. Also, I hadn't known (until I saw this film) that Darger's imaginary world was so detailed that he kept lists of the casualties on his fictional battlefields, and financial accounts of the warfare's expenses ... both of these figures exceeded the thousands of millions! I was intrigued to learn that the Chicago-born Darger attempted to reinvent himself as Henry Dargarus, native of Brazil (where the nuts come from). This behaviour is absolutely typical of someone who experienced long-term sexual abuse in childhood, and who desires a new identity as a means to blot out those memories. For most of his life, Darger lived in one room of the house of Nathan Lerner, an aspiring artist in his own right who ultimately made his impact in the art world as the curator of Darger's work. Lerner's widow is interviewed here. Yu mentions that the Lerners eventually subsidised Darger's rent, but doesn't mention that they later made a fortune by auctioning many of Darger's girlscapes after his death. Filmmaker Yu scrupulously documents Darger's obsessions. One of these was for weather patterns, specifically storms. (Darger was present when a cyclone levelled an Illinois town in 1913.) Another of his obsessions was rather odder. In 1911, a five-year-old Chicago girl named Elsie Parobek was abducted and strangled; the case remains unsolved. Darger was in Chicago at the time, age 19, and he obsessed over this girl for the rest of his life. Some Dargerphiles theorise that he may have killed her. But there is no evidence for that, and Yu's film commendably sticks to the known facts. Was Darger a paedophile? From what I've read, I believe that he was sexually aroused by little girls (and may have wanted to *be* one), but that his desire to protect girls (including Parobek) was sincere, and that he would have been genuinely repelled by the thought of sexual activity with children. We can't know for sure, but Darger was almost certainly a virgin when he died, precisely one day after his 81st birthday. 'In the Realms of the Unreal' uses several gimmicky visual devices. The decision to make animated cartoons from several Darger murals is a good one, and the stiff-legged 'lazy' animation technique used here is appropriate to the material. Less commendable is Yu's decision at several points to use new artwork that paraphrases Darger's themes; audiences will mistake these images for actual Darger artwork. I'll rate this powerful documentary 8 points out of 10."
6755,"Comedy?; Having decided to watch this due to its rating I am thoroughly disappointed that there are so many people with such terrible taste. First, there was no comedic value (other than laughing at how terrible the whole film was). Secondly, the story was a good concept but the execution felt a little sarcastic. If these 2 guys were crazy/mad then its OK if you allow them to be it throughout the film. Don't switch and change their personalities. Well, in my opinion its only worth watching if you are trying to break a world record for number of crap films watched..... 2/10"
8376,"Hilarious!; I was so surprised to see so many incredibly negative comments. And I just wanted to comment to say that if you hated it, then you just didn't get the humor. and that doesn't make it a bad movie. Personally I thought it was hilarious. Give it another shot. Not all movies have to have some powerful plot or story to be entertaining. And to those who said they thought the characters lacked emotion, hi, that's how they were supposed to be. Don't you get it? ARG! It's just such a simple and entertaining and I was so surprised by some of the comments. Don't listen to them. The characters are different and fresh and of course, extremely funny. This movie is very different from ""normal"" comedies which is why it is so great. I loved it."
165393,"When will it come to video?; I loved this movie of classical romance and a different look at the common fairytale. I saw this movie when it aired on TV and have been waiting for it to come to video since. So, when will it be released? Huh? Huh? Huh? Great movie. I was just fifteen years old when I saw it and I was entranced by the movie's magic. This movie can appeal to any age. This movie is like Ever After meets King Arthur. It was refreshing to see a different side than the common Cinderella is the victim story. People got to see a touch at a sister and feel empathy for her. I think that the story was always meant to expand on the sisters. They shouldn't just be the ugly ones. There is inherently so much more depth to people."
6541,"fun, but mostly not believable; After having heard tons of comments about this movie, and few good ones at that, I finally saw this movie after having watched Van Helsing a few days before and I'll say this at least, this film is definitely better. The acting is good, and the characters are decently developed. The special effects are well done and it comes off as a generally fun movie. The downside is that the movie has so many things in it that are completely unbelievable that, even tho the movie IS fun, you can't help but feel amused by how stupid some of the scenes are, this is a fun movie to rent if you're into getting together with friends and making fun of poorly made movies. I could go on into a long tirade but brevity might be the better part of reviewing here. This movie might be worth a viewing once as the plot isn't completely predictable, but you sure as hell shouldn't buy it."
1840,"A Great Movie for Anyone Who Plays Ball at Any Level; I recently watched this movie for the first time, and as a 19 year old black male it spoke to me. However, I can see this being a film that everyone can appreciate. Especially now, with Lebron James and other upcoming HS athletes, you really see the other side of life that only they know. This movie detailed the life of the #1 basketball star in HS, and the issues he deals with before he announces his plans for the future, further complicated by his father's contingent release from jail. A GREAT movie, don't let the votes fool you, it's not a 6.5/10, more like 8.5."
940,"Shadows Dancing on the Wall; Although a very dull film overall, the only redeeming feature about it is the duel between Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone. Once they both explode into the action, the film starts to take off, but a bit too late to maintain audience interest. However, the duel itself is worth noting because it comes a year after 'The Prisoner of Zenda'. Flynn and Rathbone feel each other out first before they aim for the kill. In 'Zenda' they combine their fighting with a combination of repartee and parrying. In this film it is omitted. That may be why it was a dull film overall because there wasn't sufficient dialogue to pull the whole thing together."
7369,"A highly polished, highly developed sequel; As sequels go Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed is a good film. It's plot is a highly contrived, and tightly interwoven blend of modern day American youth struggling to combat the pressures and stresses forced upon them by outside influences. In this cinematic production, a great deal of that pressure is forced upon them by the cunning media moguls that closely follow their every move. I believe that this successfully conveys the pressures we can all feel from time to time from ones close to us, like our parents, for example. Teen angst is also explored thoroughly in this film when Velma (the intellectual one of the group) begins to doubt her sexual appeal to the males present in her life, in particular Patrick whom she meets during an exhibition being held at the city's museum. Through adversity Velma battles to forge her place on the plain of existence within the very real world in which she dwells. Shaggy and Scooby are the real centrepieces of the performance. They are ideally placed for illustrating to us all how each of us tries to 'fit in' with society, even though society itself can sometimes not be what we're looking for and can appear both bland and boring. Through these 2 characters alone the director, Raja Gosnell, takes his viewers on a roller-coaster of emotions, including self-doubt, lack of confidence, a wanting to please others and ultimately a triumphant return to form and the adoration and respect of those closest to us in our lives. Something I believe we are all striving for. Scooby Doo 2 justifies the use of modern day cinema as a medium for conveying to us, the public, the difficulties of living and coping in today's world. But, it also shows us that with a little bit of self-belief and the support of others, we can achieve our ultimate goals and be accepted as an individual within society as whole. The special effects rocked too."
4980,"A wild, imaginative and eccentric fantasy; Sequels rarely improve on the originals. Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is bursting at the seams with wacky humor, craziness and invention. Yes, the first was a brilliant ride too but it doesn't live up to this. Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter are just great in their dual roles as good Bill and Ted and evil Bill and Ted robots from the future. I've never really seen Keanu as convincing in anything else, maybe it's the characters he chooses and not his talent. Too bad his biggest exposure has been as a wooden statue in the god-awful Matrix trilogy. But it's not just Reeves and Winter this time, William Sadler's Grim Reaper is also along for the ride and he steals the show like you've never seen before. Rufus isn't in this one for very long but William Sadler more than makes up for that. The plot is a bit much to swallow if you're not familiar with the mechanics of the original. A nasty old tyrant 700 years in the future sends evil robot Bill and Teds back through time in the phone booth time machines to kill the good Bill and Ted and prevent their perfect society taking over the world. Once dead Bill and Ted go to hell, challenge the Grim Reaper to a game of Battleship, visit God (after a spot of mugging in heaven), get help from a Martian, brought back from the dead, make good Bill and Ted robots and take on the evil Tyrant guy during a Battle of the Bands finale. Whew! Peter Hewitt (only 25 at the time) brings a bizarre sophistication to the sequel that wasn't present in the blandly shot first film. B&TBJ literally looks like a whacked-out cartoon come to life. The production design is very colorful and vivid, reminiscent of Tim Burton, only not crap. Don't misjudge this film as being in the same sub-genre as those awful stoners Jay and Silent Bob or even Wayne's World. This is not a dumb generation Xer film, it's a lovely, silly fantasy for all ages and is definitely superior to the original. Hey Warner, hurry up and release the Bill and Ted animated series on DVD. I want it NOW! Unlike Excellent adventure, this film was shot in plain-old 1.85:1 and the anamorphic transfer on the DVD looks fine and does justice to the very broad color pallet of film. The soundtrack is in Remastered Dolby 5.1 and it sounds above average if not amazing. Definitely get this. Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is thoroughly non-non-non heinous."
31869,"Meting out Death with Energetic Beauty; The 34 year old Victor Mature as Samson metes out death with energetic beauty both at his wedding feast (poor lad) and whilst bound on the road. It is an inspired moment where he unleashes an explosion of power, picking off soldier by soldier one by one. He draws them in to his own style of fighting rather than engaging in Philistine tactics, and manages to get the better of them. I love the way he hurls the sword and the spear into the backs and front of the Philistines, cutting through armour, flesh and bone. The centrifugal force that he uses to smash the skulls of the Philistines on the road is probably akin to Bruce Lee's 'The Big Boss' where he fights his way out of the ice factory. Fantastic piece of action."
8861,"Top notch entertainment; I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I quite liked the original, but knew they could improve on it and in this sequel they have. Events centre around Racoon city being quarantined after the T-virus is leaked into the atmosphere causing everyone to mutate into zombies and the like. A small group of survivors are assigned the task of retrieving Dr Ashford's daughter (the guy who invented the T-virus) who is trapped in the city. However, umbrella are hellbent on killing everyone in order to contain the outbreak and they deploy their top-secret bio-weapon NEMESIS into the disease ridden city. Cue lots of action scenes all held together by a decent storyline. Sienna Guillory is taste and plays the Jill Valentine character well and Milla Jovovich returns in the lead role and is pleasing on the eye too. I look forward to a third film, if they make one. Should be good. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."
8019,"Good film, not that scary, but good anyway; Dark Water is an enjoyable film, but it's not as scary as other Japanese horrors. However, I did enjoy it. Everyone else has outlined the plot so I'm not going to. The ghost in the movie is quite creepy but nowhere near as creepy as the ghosts in say Ring or The Grudge. I am quite interested to see if the forthcoming Hollywood version of this film ups the scare factor any. I think the overall tale trying to be told in this film is that a mother will do anything to protect her child. Which is nice if you think about it. Roll on the next Japanese horror film. I love em. I like American ones too, but Japanese ones usually have a better story."
4440,"The Power of Holding Back; Throughout this film you see a constrained Bruce Lee. Lo Wei is deliberately holding him back in order to introduce him to audiences and to save the best of his fighting for the second film. What we see here is a humane Bruce Lee who has feelings, a sense of humour, enjoys sex and is in control of his temper. He strikes up a good friendship with Shu Sheng who life is eventually claimed by the antagonists. When Bruce witnesses the mistreatment of his family in the workplace, he still holds back. Until...they break his necklace. At that moment, he explodes into action with centrifugal force, picking off each opponent with pin-point accurate kicks. It is a work of art that is akin to 'Samson and Delilah'."
1704,"Powerful; I find it hard to believe that the people who rated this movie low really got the point of Good Will Hunting. I am moved every time I watch it to the point of tears. The language and the acting is just so incredibly real. Everyone knows a Will Hunting type and can relate to that. Or at least I know I do. The message about letting people in and trusting others isn't slammed into your face. Rather, it's shown through real emotion. Although most of us know a Will, I wish we could all have a Sean in our lives. I love this movie and I never get sick of it. It is so original and well written. I stand by my rating of ten. Give it a second chance all of you negative people."
145376,"a surprisingly absorbing, moody tale; Many may find this slow going, but it is beautifully shot, and compellingly strange. This kind of folk myth is not often seen on the screen, and hardly ever in such a low-key, erotic style. And there is nothing so terrible about the soundtrack, except perhaps to opera snobs who can't bear to hear Verdi put to use in such an out-of-context way. Not a great film, but above-average for this genre. The Japanese countryside is gorgeous, the atmospherics are evocative, and the actors, particularly the women, are all first rate. Throw in some fascinating scenes of paper making, and on the other hand, some beautifully framed sex scenes, and this is certainly much more watchable than many of its American equivalents."
5796,"For 60s stylists only; One could be forgiven for thinking Casino Royale was written under the influence of 1967's hippest drug, LSD. Just like acid, there's plenty of groovy visuals, but it's impossible not to lose the plot. Today's audiences will find little to sustain them during this two hour trip unless, like me, they're fans of 60s modernist design and fashion. On the modernist front, the most unforgettable set is Ursula Andress' apartment, which comes complete with giant fish tank, sunken lounge, revolving bed and various pink pieces of classic mod furniture. The villain's lair, with its biomorphic sculptures and shapes, follows close behind. Also notable for a set design point of view are the back rooms at the Blau Engel in Berlin, which pay homage to the Futurist-inspired, distorted angles and perspectives used in the sets for the early German cinema classic, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. Musically, the score represents the great Bacharach at his cheesiest. It's saved only by Dusty Sprinfield's seductive version of The Look of Love, which beautifully underscores the seduction scene in which we first see Andress' amazing pad."
8947,"It never forgets...neither will I!; Omigosh, this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever, ever seen. To say that i love horror movies would be an understatement, and i have seen heaps (considering the limited availability in New Zealand, that's quite a lot), but never before have i had to sleep with the light on...until i saw The Grudge. Some may say that it is a rip off of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror movies), both similar (yet different) story lines, but the Grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema, i even screamed at a certain point in the movie. The acting is great, particularly from the supporting characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother looks like he is having fun. However, while i am normally a fan of Clea DuVall's, she doesn't really seem into this movie. Of the supporting characters, hers probably got the most depth and back story, but she doesn't seem like she is all there. As for Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she stays about the same through all her films and roles doesn't she? The ghosts were genuinely scary, the music and sound effects were chilling (particularly the noise being made when KaDee Strickland's character answered the phone in her apartment), the ending was cool too. Super highly recommended. 9/10"
8376,"it gets funnier every time i see it; Napoleon dynamite is the most quotable movie since princess bride. Most of my friends have seen it, and we quote lines from it in our regular conversations almost constantly. And it never gets old. The more you see it and the more you quote it, the more you'll laugh at it. Before you watch it, you need to be in right frame of mind: it is EXTREMELY dry. The humor is based on how melodramatic Napoleon is and how much he romanticizes things like martial arts and ""skills"" of any kind. And you have to love his moon boots! If you've never known someone at all like that, you may not think its funny. I know a few people who didn't like it, and those who don't like it, absolutely hate it. But those of us who like it, love it. And most people like it."
27875,"Amazing; I was amazed and impressed at Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Stanley Tookie Williams. As a result of seeing this movie, I purchased the book - and have just received it in the mail. I'm just digging into it, and can't wait. I highly recommend purchasing the book - if I'm not mistaken, the proceeds are being used to end gang violence, give kids alternatives to gangs, and other philanthropic projects. Tookie is not reaping the benefits of the book (to preempt all the cynical people out there). I wish Jamie had won the Golden Globe tonight for his portrayal of Tookie Williams - (he did win for his portray of Ray Charles). I can't say enough, how truly impressed I was with his work in this film."
30816,"Excellent transition from stage to film; I'll try to keep this short and to the point. I have seen the stage production with my partner 3 times (San Francisco, San Diego and last year (2004) in Salt Lake City). He has seen the stage production many more times that me. So, with that history, we went to the see big screen version tonight having no idea what to expect. I hadn't read any reviews previously. All I can say is that it is excellent. The movie did everything to me (shivers, tears etc) that the live version has done and then some. I think the casting was perfect, the sets and camera work superb, and Schumachers' skill in taking advantage of using film to portray what Webber couldn't do on stage was just wonderful. It filled in so many areas left to the imagination. Although I had a pretty clear understanding of the story (albeit rather simple), you leave the movie theater with no doubt in your mind about what's going on. Looking forward to seeing it again on the big screen and owning the DVD. 10/10"
26587,"Made for TV, it's a masterpiece in any forum.; It's worth noting that about the same time this was airing on censored, Communist Poland TV, America was airing the ""Heart to Heart reunion"" and ""V"". Obviously, the Ten Commandments themes that it reportedly addressed in order are not actually in order, some of the shorts address two and even three commandments. No worries, though. This collection is a masterpiece. It's a major accomplishment with every film short being watchable, and some being unquestionable masterpieces. Kieszlowski is a master of presenting both sides of the argument; the pregnant, cheating wife and the cuckolded husband's doctor; the peeping Tom and the lonely woman; the atheist father and the religious sister. The final film centers on two brothers who inherit the stamp collection of their recently deceased father. They come to find that the collection is priceless and they scheme to sell it, mistrusting their father's former colleagues and ultimately one another. But despite their eventual downfall, the brothers find something of value from their folly. It's wonderfully affirming without being sentimental. That sentence probably describes most of these shorts."
8807,"Thank you come again!; Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle Starring: John Cho, Kal Penn, Neil Patrick Harris, Anthony Anderson (brief appearance), Ryan Reynolds (brief appearance), David Krumholtz, Eddie Kaye Thomas and Paula Garces Genre: Comedy Rated: R Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle is just like the movie ""Dude Where's My Car?"" especially since it has two guys who go on a stupid but yet funny adventure. This movie is about Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) who are twenty-something year old stoners who are roommates and one is a investment banker and the other is trying to be come a medical school student. One night they get a craving for some late night snacks and they wanted to eat something that they haven't had in a while like White Castle. So Harold and Kumar go on this outrageous adventure by going all over New Jersey to look for a White Castle but every time they got on the road they kept running into trouble like a raccoon in the car, stopping at a hospital and a college, picking up Neil Patrick Harris who later steals Harold and Kumar's ride! I was laughing my head of from the first part of the movie to the last part of the movie! When this movie came out I didn't know that there are some White Castles that are still around. Because now they're just in some locations instead of all over the country like they were in the 1990's. This movie is one of those movies were it's so stupid but really funny anyway, Harold & Kumar are just great and yet lovable characters. This movie is highly recommended to those who love stoner comedy movies."
4441,"Worse than laughable; If you thought Ed Wood's movies were bad, you ain't seen nothing yet. Here we have a movie built around a dead guy, with a story almost as dead as the poster child. Ergo, we see ""Bruce Lee"" from the back, ""Bruce Lee"" from a distance, ""Bruce Lee"" in large dark glasses, ""Bruce Lee's"" face in shadow, etc., etc. And we hear recordings of Bruce Lee's kung fu sounds (probably mixed in with some non-Lee imitations) being played over and over, sounding misplaced and absolutely awful. This is not a Bruce Lee movie; it is an almost Bruce Lee-less movie. And, tackily, scenes of Bruce Lee's funeral are used to illustrate the fake funeral of the character of Billy Lo. It is the very definition of a travesty. All the characters are walking clichés that can only be laughed at, if even that. The story is basically about tracking down bad guys and brutally killing them. Whoopee. There are a couple of semi-interesting fight scenes toward the end, but even they, as well as the in-and-of-themselves-less-than-terrible Bruce Lee stand-ins (I'm actually a big fan of Yuen Biao), cannot salvage this movie from its abysmal status as one of the most embarrassing movies ever made. 1 out of 10."
518,"Excellent slapstick comedy; I've recommended this film to countless friends, and the reviews are always mixed. I lived in Battle Creek for 3 years so perhaps it just means more to me. This film was in fact shot in NY and NC, not Battle Creek, but they still did a great job portraying the romance of the early 1900's. The performances are top notch and the actors in this film are give their best. It's a great film, but not a critically acclaimed movie. Dana Carey could've had more lines, but what I want to know is what happened to the character actor who played him as a child, this kid was really great and could've been huge. The one liners in this movie are classic. It's one of those films that you think is funny, but when you recall it at a later date, its even funnier. So get a big, buttered bowl of popcorn and enjoy it for what it is! A hilarious tale of the wacky health craze of the early 1900's."
102376,"Triad comedy-drama with gay twist; ENTER THE PHOENIX (Da Lao Ai Mei Li) Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 Sound format: Dolby Digital Teen idol Stephen Fung directed and co-wrote this frothy nonsense - his first solo directorial effort - in which the conventions of 'Triad cinema' are basically turned on their head. Unsurprisingly, Fung tapped Daniel Wu for the leading role, not only because they began their careers together as co-stars in BISHONEN (1998) and have been paired in numerous movies since - including GEN-X COPS (1999) and DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART (2002) - but also because Wu is one of the few topline actors in Hong Kong willing to take risks with his screen persona, even in something as innocuous as ENTER THE PHOENIX. Here, he plays a young gay man forging a successful career in Thailand after being exiled many years earlier by his estranged father (screen legend Yuen Biao), the head of a wealthy Triad organization. When Yuen dies, his minions (represented by comic father-and-son duo Law Kar-ying and Chapman To) are ordered to retrieve the boy and establish him as head of the family business, but Law and To mistake Wu's straight roommate Eason Chan for Yuen's absent son, and Wu is happy to play along with the deception, until a childhood rival (played by Fung himself) emerges from the shadows to avenge his father's death at Yuen's hands... This light-hearted romp touches all the necessary bases, but the results are decidedly mixed. Comedy is emphasized at the expense of drama and tension, and the narrative wanders from scene to scene, without apparent motive, taking a mixed cast of veterans and newcomers along for the ride: Fung and Wu are the nominal stars of the show, and both are fine in their respective roles, but Chan (currently one of HK's most popular lightweight actors) takes center stage as the Chow Yun-fat wannabe whose fantasies of a glamorous Triad lifestyle are shot down in flames by the dangerous reality of life in the firing line. Industry stalwart Michael Chan plays a rival gangster who must preserve the status quo in the wake of Yuen's death, while comedy favorite Karen Mok essays the role of Michael Chan's daughter, a scatterbrained insurance employee who falls for Wu whilst struggling to emerge from her father's shadow (thankfully, this is one gay movie in which the heroine *doesn't* get her man!). Watch out for crowd-pleasing cameo appearances by Nicholas Tse (playing someone with an extremely rude name!), Sam Lee and co-producer Jackie Chan. Lavishly mounted on a blockbuster budget, the movie is wholly commercial in concept and execution, though the director's lack of confidence is betrayed by some rough edges, including fluffed linking shots and a tendency toward self-indulgence. Fung's lack of experience is further exposed during the various fight scenes (choreographed by action director Ma Yuk-sing), all of which are filmed and edited in a fluid, cinematic style at odds with the surrounding footage, and the rousing climax becomes a celebration of 'wire-fu' as Fung and Wu engage in hand-to-hand combat. In other departments, the wide frame (derived from a Super 35 negative) looks cramped and misaligned in places, and there's a surfeit of close-ups which minimizes the film's visual impact, though novice cinematographer Davy Chow is co-billed alongside veteran Poon Hang-sang (one of the finest DP's in Hong Kong movie history, an old-school technician whose luxurious compositions recall the Technicolor glamour of a bygone era), who was clearly responsible for some of the movie's most striking images, including a superbly rendered sequence in which Chan arrives at the ceremony where he'll be sworn-in as Yuen's successor, filmed in slow motion amidst a sea of umbrellas during a dramatic rainstorm. The film's 'gay' element is basically a red herring, used as comic relief for the most part, and while some of the material borders on crude stereotype, Wu himself plays the central character with great dignity, reaffirming his status as a gay icon. Ultimately, however, the movie is uneven and disappointing, though redeemed by its energetic cast. If Fung can resist playing to the gallery in future, he might yet prove himself a director of note, far beyond the loyalty of his devoted fan base. NB. The witty animated icon which accompanies the on-screen title is a particularly nice touch, and wholly typical of this freewheeling extravaganza. (Cantonese dialogue)"
1757,"An uninvolving messy affair that looks great and is directed with considerable style; After yet another bullet wound from a tough job, Wong Chi-Ming decides it is time to quit the hit-man trade and decides to break off the business partnership with his agent, unaware that she loves him. Meeting the wild Baby offers him a chance at happiness but he soon finds that the Agent is not going to let him go so easily. Meanwhile the mute He Zhiwu makes his living re-opening closed shops overnight until he finds Charlie, who is trying to find her ex-boyfriend's new lover. Helping her sees He falling for Charlie himself and ending up hunting for her when she disappears. Thanks to a really poor service recently from my cable TV provider, I had a poor reception on this film and that may be part of the reason that I found this difficult to really get involved in. I say this from the start because I think the film has major flaws and I suspect that newly converted fans of Kar Wai Wong will just dismiss my opinions as those of a fool (maybe they are right). With his newest film about to be one of his widest releases yet in the UK, I chose to step back for a minute and view an earlier film just to allow me to view his new film and see how he has changed (if he has) from early days, through Mood For Love up to his present state. The first thing that hits you about this film is really the thing that is the main reason for watching the film  the visual style. Kar Wai Wong is undobutably a great stylistic director and this film is beautiful to look at and features some really imaginative shots. Chris Doyle's vision of Hong Kong is excitingly fluid and works well with the direction and the film is visually consistently engaging. The problem I had with the film was that the material didn't get anywhere near this sublime level and I found the whole thing to be rather messy and unengaging. The plot is delivered with energy but it still doesn't really hang together and it almost feels silly at times. I must admit that I gave it as much time as I could but after an hour I didn't care about the characters any more than I had before I saw the film; I still watched the film but was interested by the style a lot more than the story. Reflecting this I didn't think the cast had a great deal to do and that Wong, as he seems prone to do, stole the film from under them by becoming the reason for the film and not the deliverer of the film. Lai and Reis are good despite the material but for the most part I just didn't get into Kaneshiro or Mok at all. Overall this is not a bad film and it is worth seeing; sadly it is worth seeing mainly because of the direction and cinematography. Outside of this we are left with characters it is hard to really ever understand or care about and a plot that is energetic and has some value but is too messy and unengaging. Wong has done better and there are examples of his films where his direction doesn't overly impact on the story  this isn't really one of them."
6284,"Excellent comedian; This is a good movie, especially the concert part. Eddie is a great mimic. Check out this movie if you want to laugh a lot. Also, noticed that Eddie looks a lot like Alan Keyes. The part about different religions is great. Not for everyone, as some people, especially the people who should see a film like this, wont go because they don't want to expose their delicate ears to profanity but have no problem with all the crap that goes on in the world. Funnier than Chris Rock if you ask me. Also, this movie gives a good idea of how people are like in the Midwest as the concert takes place in the Midwest. Check it out if you want to see a good movie. Kabish?"
8954,"The essence of the Blues; Lightning in a Bottle was not exactly what I expected. I went into the film expecting more of a documentary, and came out with more of a concert film. Yes, there were bits of history in the film, which were well presented. I am not terribly knowledgeable on the blues; just having enjoyed the music rather than learning it's history. Regardless of what I expected versus what I got, I enjoyed the film. My favorite scene was simply a great camera angle. Watching Buddy Guy play, from below the guitar, while the light streamed between his deftly moving fingers gave me a feeling that is difficult to describe. Something about the light, and the music, and the hands that brought me there. Several of the musical numbers were outstanding, notably Buddy Guy, BB King, Natalie Cole and Bonnie Raitt. I also enjoyed some of the ""oldsters"" like Hooker and Clarence Gatemouth Brown. When Angélique Kidjo convinced Buddy Guy to come back on stage and accompany her on ""Voodoo Chile"" I was amazed! She was so full of energy, and she had that old pro wrapped around her tiny finger as she strutted on stage. To me, the performance was electric, and the smile on Guy's face makes me think he agreed. I also enjoyed watching India.Arie perform Strange Fruit. Her voice is soothing, and there was an underlying passion that I think embodies the blues. As for Lightning in a Bottle...I think it was described in the film, but not named specifically. It was said that you can write down all the lyrics, and the notes, there is still unmistakably something not present on the page. It takes a blues artist to find the missing essence and infuse it into the performance. If we could bottle it, we'd be millionaires, huh?"
5171,"Are you crazy?; Are you people crazy?? The Time Machine was a great movie. If you can honestly tell me the effects were not good, then wou have problems. There only two scenes in the entire movie that you can tell are fake. Obviously the morlocks are fake, but can you tell by looking at them? No. And I haven't read the book, but even if the movie is different from the book, it is still a good movie. For one, the time machine really looks like it would take you through time, the computer graphics are amazing when he's going to 802,701, and the whole Eloi civilization is breathtaking. Living on cliff sides?? Genius. The fight scene with Alex and the hunter morlock is awesome, and the encounter with the uber morlock was so well written. All in all, this is a great movie."
6290,"Awesome Movie!  Scary as Hell!; What can I say. I absolutely love this movie. It was one of the 1st horror movies to ever scare me. The whole thing (until they are lowered in the coffins) is incredibly believable, especially since all of the tortures performed can actually happen. The acting of the Firefly family and Sid Haig as the wonderful Captain Spaulding was really well done. The two couples were annoying which is why their killings and tortures was so much fun to watch. I looked at other user comments on how it was too gory and too violent. Well what did you expect? Some psychological talking thriller? No. It's a gory movie with a sadistic family. Notice the word Sadistic. That doesn't mean oral communication and torture. It means physical. There was plenty of it to please the eye. I own the DVD and even if you don't like the movie, it's worth renting just for the DVD menus. The main menu has a huge rant by the one and only Spaulding. The scene selection has the creepy yet somehow attractive Otis. The special features has the lovable Baby Firefly. Last but not least, is settings where Otis, Baby, and Spaulding have a funny conversation. In Bonus Features, there is a feature called Tiny F*cked a Stump which is hilarious! -Spiolers- Probably the scene that scared me the most is when the girl Denise is underground in the tunnel once her bunny suit is ripped off. She then cries and looks around. Just that is so frightening to me. I love the part where Baby lip sinks Helen Kane's ""I Wanna Be Loved By You"" and afterwords she says to May who was cruel and a b*tch ""I'll cut your f*cking tits off and shove them down your throat!!"" You also really get terrified when you see Mary tied up to a chair when Otis comes and gives a little rant. Then proceeds to show her her boyfriend who is now Fishboy! This movie has it's incredibly unusual and odd moments. Almost as odd as Natural Born Killers. Anyway, this movie is worth watching."
8861,"Will appeal to teenage dumb asses; This is the kind of movie that will appeal to 15 year olds addicted to video games and suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder. Any extended dialog beyond 30 seconds would lose them in confusion and slow the pace of the film down. Doh... Jeez, this is even worse than the first one (which I thought had some potential had they not held back on the gore) with lousy CGI, bad dialog and hokey action sequences. In fact, what little dialog there is, is held to tired, smart-alecky remarks and the standard clichés that we've heard ka-zillion times before. Same old, same old.... (yawn....) All the characters in the film are clichés themselves with the men acting either evil or irrelevant (and not terribly smart) while the action babes hold the show in an effort to get the horny teenage males juices going. It's all part of that bogus ""let's empower women"" act that Hollywood's been hooked on the last few years, only they don't have Michelle Rodriguez in there to make it look convincing. She's one of the few out there who can carry off that kind of thing and make the action babe look entertaining, as far as I'm concerned. Too bad she was killed off in the first film. There's nothing new about this. It's not even a particularly interesting story this time around, but with today's wigger generation, is there anything out there that is? Lowest rating. If I could give it a zero, I would. 1 out of 10"
5498,"a film deeply in touch with what's right and wrong with humanity; perfectly cast; Akira Kurosawa, behind the veneer of directing a few of Japan's most well-known/received action films (Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress), was also a master at finding the right touches in drama. With Red Beard, his final collaboration with Toshiro Mifune, he unravels from a previous novel a story with many little stories, connected with the idea that people can be devoted to helping people. Many people take for granted what doctors can do, besides the straight-forward medical side of things. They can also help bring people out of the dark into the light, or closest to it. While this may be looked upon with some skepticism and cynicism in the modern age, what's fascinating is that Red Beard is a modern film, with a timeless sensibility. It's a film shot in black and white, but it deals with characters that will always be out there, the good and the bad, the under-privileged and those who are not. But besides the themes that Kurosawa and his writers have underneath, he tells an interesting, if somewhat familiar, story of the young being brought into a world by the experienced. Dr. Yamamoto (Kuzo Kaywama) doesn't think he will work at the clinic run by Dr. Niide (Red Beard), and at first does everything in his power to resist doing anything. But then he gets drawn in bit by bit, starting with an encounter with a mentally-damaged woman (Kyôko Kagawa, who assists in making their one scene one of Kurosawa's absolute best), and observes Red Beard at work. Sometimes it's too much, but he does begin to understand what he hasn't realized yet as a doctor. Then, when a girl (Miyuki Kuwano) is struck with a fever under a repressive mother, Yamamoto takes her under his care, leading into the second half of the film. It would be one thing if Kurosawa decided to focus squarely on the relationship between Niide and Yamamoto, but because he is more interested in certain stories with the patients, so is the audience. Like a sewer, Kurosawa weaves delicately all of these little bits into the film, and often using powerful light measures in certain shots (some of which, when a dying character, Rokusuke, is shown in a flashback in CU, or when another character, Sahachi, recalls a story involving his wife, are tiny masterpieces of composition). And it's not necessarily tragic the entire way either- one scene involving a fight with Red Beard and some thugs brings out a purely comical excursion in the film. If one of the director's (not just Kurosawa but in general) is to cast with a keen eye, then this film doesn't miss out- nearly every small role is fit so one can't see it being cast any other way. Mifune, when he is on-screen, is compelling as always, but not in the same manic way he was in some of his earlier acting roles. Here he reacts calmly sometimes, attentively, and when his emotion comes through, he doesn't do the yelling and lightning fast delivery. His character, which he fits into beautifully, is far more wary of the ways of the world than some of his samurai parts were. As for the younger counterpart, Yamamoto, played by Kayawa, he is performed with the right levels in how the character transforms- frustrated, shocked, observant, understanding, caring, sympathetic. And there are other parts that are played without a note missed- Onaka, played by Kuwano, is perhaps the Japanese equivalent to what Jodie Foster was in her youth- determined, believable, and of course vulnerable. There is a tendency for some Japanese actors to take it a little to far into the over-reaching, but her work here is far from that. I was emotionally moved by Red Beard, and in a way that some films just can't do. Some films overpower with melodrama to mark its points. Red Beard delves into questions that those other films (which may or may not have fine emotional content) wouldn't raise. There is an underlying current in the story that the clinic is under-funded for Red Beard. He cannot fathom why this is so, not that they can't get the money they need to treat the under-privileged, but why the under-privileged are there in the first place. But then with the film, the questions coincide well with the dramatic structure and catharsis pulled by the end. It's a typical kind of conclusion, but it's worthy of such. One of Kurosawa's better films; not one to start with if you're not familiar with the director's film, yet a treat for those ready for a three-hour trip into a world we know and don't know at once."
26202,"'La Dolce Vita', Metzger-style!; CAMILLE 2000 Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Panavision) Sound format: Mono Whilst visiting Rome, an amorous nobleman (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but their unlikely romance is opposed by Castelnuovo's wealthy father (Massimo Serato), and Fate deals a tragic blow... A sexed-up love story for the swinging Sixties, adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas' 'La Dame aux Camelias') by screenwriter Michael DeForrest, and directed with freewheeling flair by Radley Metzger who, along with the likes of Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is credited with redefining the parameters of 'Adult' cinema throughout the 1960's and 70's. Using the scope format for the last time in his career, Metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), though the film's sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards. Production values are handsome throughout, and the performances are engaging and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite weak post-sync dubbing. Though set in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's wacked-out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period, and Piero Piccioni's 'wah-wah' music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of this director's elegant softcore erotica won't be disappointed. Next up for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider his best film."
3552,"Get drunk first.; There are several classic comedies that, at the time of this writing, I've never seen, like Animal House, Groundhog Day, and, until yesterday, Caddyshack. Maybe I just expected more, but I found Caddyshack to be pretty disappointing. The only funny people in the movie are Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield, and the latter only sporadically. Rodney Dangerfield has this style of comedy that is brilliant in stand-up, but in a film it is not very conducive to repeat viewings. His style is too spontaneous to be funny more than once or twice, but was still funnier in this movie by leaps and bounds than Bill Murray, who turned in an astonishingly unamusing performance. A lot of times I find myself unable to sufficiently appreciate these goofball comedies, because when they reach the level of cult classic that this movie has, I really expect them to be side-splittingly hilarious, which Caddyshack simply is not. On the other hand, I think my sense of humor has matured beyond the ability to fully appreciate the crude humor for which 80s comedies are often so well known, so maybe I'm wrong (note: I'm not wrong). Structurally, the movie is very well made. When it ultimately gets around to the real conflict in the movie rather than concentrating on the stupid clash between the drunken teen caddies and the snooty rich folk that populate the curiously named Bushwood Country Club, there is some genuine tension created. Bill Murray plays a groundskeeper caricature (replacing groundskeeper Willie, who showed up in the beginning of the movie and then promptly and inexplicably disappeared completely) who is assigned by the club's owner to get rid of the gophers that have somehow made it onto the golf course and proceeded to tear huge ruts into the putting greens. Murray's role for the rest of the movie is to plot huge military vengeance against the offending gopher, who really only wants to listen to good music and get his groove on. I'm not sure whose talent is more wasted, Murray's or the gopher's. I've found recently that watching any documentaries provided with the DVDs almost invariably makes me appreciate the movie more. I liked this movie much more after I watched the cast and crew talking about their experiences in making it, much as my appreciation was lifted by similar documentaries for movies like Willard and Texas Chainsaw III, which had nowhere to go but up anyway. What I can't get over, though, is how funny Caddyshack is not. It's not that the comedy flew below my radar, so to speak, but that there is really not much effort put into making it funny. If the making-of documentary is to be believed (although I have a feeling that this was said as a joke), the screenplay was originally intended to be a drama, but not much of what was in the script ever made it into the final film. If that's true, my theory is that it was the dancing mechanical gopher that turned it from a drama into a comedy. Whatever the case, Caddyshack turned out to be one of the most famous comedies ever made, although in my opinion, not even close to one of the best."
6686,"good action mired in dreck; My god what an abysmal script, a mish mosh of dumb action movies that seems to be just going through the motions. Then there's sidekick Lee Evans, who ranks as one of the most irritating comic-relief characters to ever appear on film. Evans is even annoying playing himself in the end credit outtakes. Toss in a bland performance by the leading lady and you've got a movie that has nothing going for it but Chan. And it is a tribute to Jackie's genial charm and action choreography that I made it to the end of this nonsense. There are some genuinely fun action sequences in this, although oddly enough the best sequences are those before Chan gets the special powers at the heart of the movie. Chan is likable but he should be ashamed of himself for appearing in this garbage. I give it a 4/10, although without Chan it would be hard pressed to get above a 2."
27721,"What turns out to be, ultimately, a very long movie; Jean-Pierre Jeunet: A Very Long Engagement (2004) What turns out to be, ultimately, a very long movie A Very Long Engagement is a strange movie and, as the title implies, a very long one -- or at least for those of us who do not embrace its combination of whimsy and gore, it seems so. Nonetheless, from among all the interesting autumn film releases in France, fate and Miramax -- or was it Warner Bros.? They put up a lot of the dough -- have decreed that this costly sweet-and-sour confection be chosen as the pièce de résistence with which to charm that part of the American public who have not replaced ""French"" fries with ""liberty"" ones, and might even use the phrase ""pommes frites"". The reason is not far to seek: box office potential. Jean-Pierre Jeunet did extremely well last time with les yanquis. As foreign films go in America, his Amélie -- or, more correctly Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, was as hot as asphalt in July. It got five Oscar nominations and made a hefty (for a foreign film) $33 at the gate. But this new one is a war movie, and whimsical though the plot is, a lot has been spent on making the bombardments and mutilations, the sprays of blood, as striking as they are realistic. It certainly would seem unlikely that the art house audience will embrace A Very Long Engagement the way they did the blood-and-guts free Amélie; but you never know. Jeunet's insured himself a carry-over for fans by again featuring Amélie's winsome Audrey Tautou. (He may have fallen in love with the success of his last movie, though he's been drawn back a bit from the saccharine into gore.) Just as this is not such a cute movie, Tautou's not so cute this time either; she's reduced to clumping around manfully with a leg-length differential from childhood polio. But she's still got that smile. Indeed, what a peculiar, warped idea it is, to reduce all the horrors of World War I trench warfare to a far-fetched Rashoman-like investigation by Mathilde (Tautou) to track down a young man called Manech. Manech is played by the Gaspar Ulliel who was so feral and interesting in Téchiné's Strayed but is reduced to little more than a few flashbacks and a big dimple here. Manech was Mathilde's childhood sweetheart and briefly her fiancé. The minute they got engaged he was called off to war. They've told Mathilde that Manech is dead and she won't believe it. The filigreed, elongated tale then focuses, with Jeunet's curious unemotional obsessiveness, upon a crew of five French soldiers who've wound up, in the craziness of war and the brutal code of the trenches, getting condemned to die for self-mutilation -- a bum rap for at least one of them, who was just clumsy, or got involved in a freak accident. One of these, of course, is Manech. They were dumped in a no-man's land, the nearby French soldiers got massacred by the Germans, and nobody much was around to see what happened to the condemned prisoners. The question is, what happened to him? If he can't be quite accounted for, how do we know he's dead? And Ms. Tautou's character refuses to believe that. Okay, that's romantic. But the story's intricate, far-fetched, and intermittently gruesome. The screen is the site of some of the most elaborate and expensive mise-en-scène ever produced by the original inventors of the term. The confusions and alternative versions of what happened are impossible to summarize or to follow, and hence ultimately impossible also to care about. The love story is fragmentary, the boyfriend is a cameo. And given that Ulliel is a more expressive actor than Tautou (watch her in Frears's Dirty Pretty Things and you'll see how limited she is), that's a pity -- and a miscalculation. You keep following the elaborate, over-produced narrative, hoping it will begin to matter, that the love story will come to life either in the flashbacks or in the future, but it never does; and the extreme grimness of the trench scenes is hard to reconcile with the fairytale playfulness of the story. It seems almost insensitive, criminal, to base such cuteness on a world of blood-spattered corpses and mutilated limbs. This movie contains some very grave clashes of tone. And the most elaborate use of digital effects in a French film yet. Amid a supporting cast with considerable depth (some of all that money was spent hiring familiar faces), including Jodie Foster speaking excellent French and carrying more warmth than most of these exotic provincial gallic caricatures with regional accents and twirly moustaches, this movie includes the brilliant, and lately ubiquitous, Clovis Cornillac in it, perhaps the first time Americans will notice him -- if they can spot him through the crumpled uniform, the mud, and the blood. He bears an attention-getting name: Benoît Notre-Dame. This director is a master too much in love with his own invention and cleverness; but mind you, there are beauties here: Jeunet's over-production also means high production values which in turn means a ravishing palette rich in browns and stunning panoramas with dazzling uses of natural light. But despite a unifying, as well as distancing, voice-over narration by somebody who sounds like Mathilde but speaks of her in the third person, it's all too intricate and goes on too long to engage us. When the end comes, it's an anticlimax and brings not revelation but relief."
3993,"where there's a quill there's a way...; this is an excellent piece of work, mainly because of the acting and philip kaufmans fluid and lucid direction, but especially the writing. it is rare these days to see a film that is articulate and witty and which resonates on so many levels. the themes of hypocrisy, the duality of good and evil, and censorship and art are all explored in a way which enhances rather than hampers the plot development. any historical inaccuracies are, to my mind, irrelevant. the moral conundrums the marquis de sade presents us with here are to serve an artistic rather than a factual purpose, and if this dubious character has been represented in a way which allows us to think and reflect at the expense of historical accuracy then so be it. this is a movie that is both thought provoking and fun at the same time."
30816,"fantastic!!!!!; i LOVE this movie!!! its is now my all time favorite musical, and has joined my top five list of best movies ever! i would recommend to everyone to see this fan-freaking-tastic movie. the day after i saw it i went to two different stores to find the soundtrack before i found it. and i got the last copy. i love how almost everyone does their own singing and how great they are at it. gerard butler as the Phantom is the sexiest thing ever. and emmy rossum did a superb job as christine. my friend has seen it three times already and i am working on it myself. even guys like this movie!! it is that great! i voted a 10 for this movie because it deserves it, everyone should see this movie and then buy it when it comes out, cuz i know i am going to be there the first day!"
1197,"My favourite 'sick' film; This film is definitely the best film for days when you're off sick, snuggled up in bed and not feeling too hot, which was exactly how it was introduced to me by my mum. It always perks me up no matter what and despite the fact that it was made in the 80s it still rocks and gets better the more times you see it. If you've already seen it but haven't read the book, are you insane?! What are you reading this for? Sprint down to your nearest bookshop and get a copy!! It's ""The Princess Bride"" by William Goldman. So go! Stop reading this and read the book instead! Despite the fact that the film is one of my favourites, the book has to be my favourite book of all time and probably will remain so forever. In fact all my friends agree with me and I don't think it matters if you've seen the film first or read the book first, both should appeal to everyone! In fact I recently forced one of my friends to watch it (he's refused twice and said it looked rubbish and girlie) but behold! After about an hour I stopped it, teasing him that I wouldn't force him to watch any more of this rubbish and he looked physical pained. You should have seen the look on his face! He immediately got up and tried to get the remote off me, begging me to put it back on so he could find out what was going to happen to Wesley (I stopped it at a particularly exciting part). It's got something for everyone: there's fencing and giants and evil princes and heroes and (incredibly irritating and stupid) damsels in distress and midget geniuses and a pit of despair (the zoo of death is much better in the book) and miracles and the grandson who comes in with funny one-liners every now and again (eg ""Hold it, hold it. What is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports?(suspiciously) Is this a kissing book?"" or my favourite line: ""oh, murdered by pirates is good"") and revenge and torture and dragons, just kidding, no dragons, but it's got everything else! It's a bit like a fairytale but sooo much better. And it's funny! So you see, anyone from little kids to the elderly, girls and boys alike will enjoy this film. And if you don't then you're just a really strange person."
8977,"waste of time and money; i have been a keen follower of stone and his works, and i have been an amateur student of ancient history. so when the two were offered together as a package in Alexander, i would have wept for joy, till i entered the theatre and saw the movie . the net result is as disappointing as rain on the day of a school picnic. if oliver stone is to be believed, Alexander is in the line up for the next Nobel peace prize. Anthony Hopkins's' boring,soporific voice glosses over all of Alexander's cruelties, massacres ( he slaughtered men women and children in the plains of India and the hundukush as punishment for trying to resist him, hanging fakirs and seers , while demolishing tyre to the ground.) as for historical accuracy, anyone who claims it is so has got his history all mixed up. there is no mention or even depiction of the leftward feint at gaugmela, and the plans for the battle were revealed by Alexander to his general on the very morning of the battle, not th night before. as for the battle peter Greene considers Alexander's most skillful , the fight with porus at the hydaspes ( both because the Greeks were against elephants, and because porus and his Indians were a much tougher nut to crack than Darius), we are subjected to a skirmish in a dense thicket, with lots of confused slashing, Alexander wounded by a face pierced rajah who runs away from the battle. in fact, it was fought on the sand banks of the river, after a daring Greek night crossing which took porus by surprise, who was , incidentally captured alive. by the way, Alexander was wounded on his way home at the town of Malia. as a reprisal, the Greeks razed it to the ground and massacred every living soul , including children , goats and cattle. ( but of course, Anthony Hopkins's would shrug his shoulders as say , so what!). in conclusion, for a man who was famous as a great general and a poor public relations man, we get to see more of his public relations side and less of his military stratagems. he comes out more as a weepy confused lad who strangely enough, wins against odds. and by the way, contrary to the announcement in the beginning , Alexander did not last long in the lands he conquered. the Asians got rid of his satraps as soon as they could and reverted back to their old selves."
3739,"Lovely but...; Yes lovely plot, lovely actors, lovely directing. But all of these are quite outdated. Well, to speak frankly I was disappointed as Leo Maltin wrote it was perhaps the best Lubitsch picture. Its outdated charm is far from the universal comedy To be or not to be actually is. Anyway everything that is a bit outdated is on a tightrope between 'diverting' and 'boring'."
26383,"Orchestral portion of the score is just one in a series of amazing efforts from the late Jerry Fielding; My mixed (at best) feelings about the film as a whole are reflected in the range of previous comments. My response to the contributions of composer Jerry Fielding, however, is unadulterated awe. The harmonic richness and complexity of his music sometimes seemed wasted on the films they accompanied - i.e. ""Funeral Home"", ""Grey Lady Down, some of the Michael Winner collaborations et al - both the attention to detail his scores displayed and the complexity of response his music evoked were simply not supported by what was on screen. In fact, some of these films probably could have been served just as well if not better either by a relative hack or simply by a composer more able to work at ""half-mast"" on a given project - i.e. Goldsmith, Williams etc. Fielding's effectiveness was not restricted to scoring intense and/or violent scenes - witness his brief, exquisite interludes early and late in """"Junior Bonner"", the heartbreakingly beautiful music underscoring Warren Oates' tortured efforts to express his feelings to Isela Vega in ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"" or for that matter the many gentle moments of respite in ""The Wild Bunch"" itself. Still, some of the most imaginative and memorable marriages of sound and image in the history of film are provided by Fielding in just such intense contexts, often in scenes anticipating or immediately following violence and especially scenes of violation  i.e. the rapes of ""Straw Dogs"", the near rape of ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"", the rough sex / bondage of ""The Nightcomers"", or the not-in-itself particularly violent but perhaps even more disturbing  more violating  situation played out in ""Demon Seed"" 's centerpiece. However unbelievable or even ludicrous this scene's premise - or the ""science"" underlying it - may seem, the emotional journey the film's protagonist is forced to take is massive and mind bending (the scene turning into something somewhat reminiscent of the penultimate scene of 2001). Fielding's music is more than up to the task, amply supporting and even expanding the scope of this journey. Anyway, I think I've expended enough syllables. Fielding is one of the extremely small group of film composers whose work is just as absorbing and memorable with or without the image. So, to all those who are interested  follow the IMDb links and search  and look and listen P.S. As a previous poster has noted, the soundtrack recording is available on a cd pairing it with the score from ""Soylent Green"" by Fred Myrow. It was released by FSM (Film Score Monthly) on their Silver Age Classics label."
6157,"The best superhero movie ever made?; This is without a doubt the best superhero movie out there. Forget Spider-man with its colorful character swinging through the streets of new york. Forget Batman with it's dark brooding character and over the top comic to film transition. In half of the batman movies I half expected Wham Kasplat or kazump to show up in the middle of a fight scene. But this isn't about Batman, or spider-man for that matter. This is about Dare devil. A super hero that most people have never even heard of. Which is one of the reason's why it didn't do as good at the box office as it should have done. Which in hindsight this is a shame as some people out there are missing a great film. Right from the start we are drawn into the story by meeting a beaten up Ben Afflick in the title role. We then hear him say the immortal line ""they say that when you are about to die you see your whole life flash before your eye's. That is also true of a blind man"" And then of course we are taken to back to when the hero of the film was a normal boy growing up in a part of new york called hells kitchen. An origin story that to my mind hasn't been implemented as well in any other movie. The film doesn't let up from that moment either, and if superhero's existed they would exist in the form of dare devil. The scene where Mat Murdock return's home after dispensing of a really nasty rapist is masterful. Beaten and bruised he steps in the shower, and as the water trickles over his battered body you can see the blood trickling down the drain, then cut to his face as he pinches a single tooth that comes away from his jaw then clunks to the bottom of the shower with a ching. Then after stepping out we see him go straight to the medicine cabinet and pop some painkillers into his mouth. Then after stepping into his sound proof coffin so that he will not go mad from the high intensity sounds he is constantly hearing, he passes into something slightly less pleasurable than sleep. You know at this point that this is a super hero. There is no Aunt May or butler Alfred at home to cook him a nice cup of tea. He is completely alone. Doing what he does not to get thanks. But because he has the ability to do it. I don't even class this movie as a movie. This move is pure Art. Made and written by people that love the whole daredevil mythos. The man without fear. And to all those people that hated the movie I am sorry. I am sorry that the film hasn't got the recognition that it deserve's and i am sorry that everyone who hated the film so much hasn't really watched the film. Just remember as daredevil said in his own words. ""I'm not the bad guy"""
180393,"feel good movie; I completely disagree there. I thought this movie was a good movie. Good plot, good acting, just enough fear factor for the children. And to top it off, it all happens in the Hollywood Tower Hotel. I take it you have never been to Tower Of Terror in Florida. The Hotel is exactly how the movie describes it. A great feel good movie for you and the kids. Harmless, silly fun. It should be on TV around Halloween more. Good sets, good costumes, good music, and it has enough to keep you entertained the whole way through. Definitely has my vote for a good movie. A+"
143027,"Great Movie; This is one of only a couple high quality Disney Channel movies. I was really looking forward to this movie ever since I saw the preview for this movie. Might I say, I was shocked. It was so much better than I expected. The plot was very high quality for a Disney Channel movie. The magic was pretty cool too. There was a few good jokes in this move as well. It had a good amount of mystery and puzzle solving in this movie. I tried to figure out how they did some of the magic tricks, too. Allyson was kind of annoying at the beginning of the movie. Max creeped me out some of the times. This is probably my favorite Disney Channel movie. Second would be Tiger Cruise, and third would be Stuck in the Suburbs. I highly recommend this movie to any one out there. 5 Magic Stars"
102517,"not the worst, not the best, but plenty good; this may not be the best zatoichi title, hindered by a complicated plot and an unusually long runtime (116 mins), but it's easily an 8/10 compared to other zatoichi films (1989's 'zatoichi' being the worst and a 1 out of 10). if you're a zatoichi fan you are not allowed to miss this one or you're out of the club. shintaro katsu and toshiro mifune are in excellent form and their presence alone makes it worth seeing. both of them look great. mifune is in his post-kurosawa days, but still in his prime and his face is aged to perfection. don't expect a kurosawa filmthis series was made as entertainment, not art. of course yojimbo is a better film, but this is every bit as funny and entertaining."
147458,"Not a Bad Scary Film; A list of the neat elements of the film a.k.a. "" Horror "", a.k.a. ""The Blanchville Monster,""...1. It's Italian, 2. black and white, 3. ""Horror"" sneakily appears as an occult film but really a psychological horror film, and 4. the ultra-creepy background music. I watched this movie when I was a 10-year old watching it on shock theater late Saturday night. There are a few boring parts and some parts that should never been put into the film, such as Rodrigues playing the keyboards. But I'm a little prejudiced on bragging on this movie because I've never seen an Italian horror film I didn't like ( Black Sunday, Black Sabbath, Suspiria, Inferno, etc. )."
147055,BRILLIANT !! a must watch.; this is a brilliant comedy from the 80's. A very dramatically non-dramatic story done in a manner not re-emphasizing any crux. THe movie is done in a very laid back fashion (or this is the impression it'll give you). Each character is very simply but very artistically portrayed that immediately give their own ..very candid introduction (like omi and jai's pin-up clad wall). A very simple comedy talking to the common man. as a special note - it's easy to fall in love with Deepti Naval in this movie .. the innocent.. vulnerable.. sweet and the very 'girl next door'..who actually IS the girl next door ! also.. Delhi in late 70'z... early 80's ! if you haven't watched it already... tch tch tch.
172403,"Plodding, Perplexing, Oddly Compelling; I can see why some reviewers might not care for it, but I think this movie is incredible. It is largely associational, confusing and disjointed, and this is by no means made up for (in fact, perhaps exaggerated) by the long, dull, ex-positional monologue towards the end. But the very fact that the main character nods off repeatedly during said scene is evidence of the film's awareness of its own means and purposes, whatever they may be. Purely affectively, I can say that the experience of watching this movie, if you can let go of plot expectations, is dreamlike, hallucinogenic, thought-provoking, and, as much because of the devastatingly catchy electro-pop soundtrack as any other element, at times transcendental. A shame it's so difficult to come by; I had to buy it region 2."
7293,"Silly, Forgettable, But Having Some Funny Moments; In Hawaii, Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) is a man who makes success with women, specially the tourists. He works in an aquarium, and his best friend is Ula (Rob Schneider). One day, while having breakfast, he flirts with the local woman Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore) and they schedule a breakfast in the same place on the next day. However, in the next date, Lucy does not recognize him. Later, Henry is informed that Lucy had an accident one year ago and lost her short memory, lasting only for one day. So, he flirts with her everyday, and she falls in love for him every day. I saw ""50 First Dates"" with a great expectation, but ended completely disappointed. The storyline is silly, forgettable and not original, using a combination of the plot of ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Memento"". The funniest moments belong to Rob Schneider, in the role of a local native friend of Henry. Drew Barrymore is a little fat, but charming and sweet as usual, and Adam Sandler is in his usual role of a nice and supportive man, and their chemistry work perfectly in this romantic comedy. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "" Como Se Fosse A Primeira Vez"" (""As If It Were the First Time"")"
100562,"maddeningly pretentious; ""The Goddess of 1967"" is a maddeningly pretentious film that tries too hard to capture the flair and dynamism of new-wave film-making without the artistry to back it up. The film's first half is almost unbearable, but there are some more conventional moments in the latter stages that lend the work some much needed credibility. Clara Law's directing technique is first-year film school stuff with a lot of unnecessary appendages that do little other than distract; and the story is a fairly stale reworking of tired old themes about betrayal, revenge and redemption built upon on a narrative of incest and sexual transgression. The Japanese sub-plot and characters seem tacked on to lend an air of otherness that seems redundant. The failure of the approach is emphasised by the weak script that often times reads likes poor poetry (I was reminded of David Brent's ""Excalibur""). Even Rose Byrne's gorgeous face can do little to make this film watchable."
4866,"good not great movie; If seen the movie with my family in the weekend, rent hem. the script was very good, the casting was also very good. two great actors against each other in a psychology war. the location of the castle was a bit of Grey maybe on purpose. had some great action time,also great psycho moments between the great. I don't want you to tell you to much, you must seen for your self. it was not a waist of time to seen the movie it have great and amusing moments. my family members also enjoyed the movie. But the end still life you on your hungry, to many questions of the result of all that action. i hope my comment Will not stop you from seen the movie."
27180,"This film is worth every moment!; Joan of Arc is indeed my biggest hero of all time! Everything about her, beauty,brains and her remarkable courage. Leelee Sobieski is incredible in this film, she takes it all in total stride. The passion with which she portrays her role is..... I am at a loss for words! I admit it with pride, I cried like a baby. It's that good. The medieval fight scenes were well done, in many aspects too. Some of the special effects are somewhat unrealistic, but it gets the point across. Very well, actually. The other actors did their parts well. They definitely showed their love for her, as it does in the true story. If you want to see a true, fascinating story of faith then, see this movie!"
8951,"Wife. Mother. Criminal. Oscar winner?; Isn't it ironic? As directors and studios reach for ever bigger budgets, more outrageous effects and more provocative opinions to try and move what they see as increasingly jaded cinemas audience, films like Vera Drake prove the old cliché that less is often more. Vera Drake is typical of Mike Leigh in its economy of plot and dialogue. But it had my audience rapt nonetheless as its simple stories unfolded. You can read long dissertations here on the merits of Vera Drake but I will attempt to exercise similar economy with 9 reasons why you should see this film. 1. Imelda Staunton. A time-served, quality supporting actress in British films: gives the performance of her career to date. 2. The film's portrayal of Britain in 1950. The post-war years in Britain are intriguing and under-reported. Leigh portrays vignettes of them with affection but avoiding nostalgia. 3. What the film has to say about abortion. With credit, it deals with the 'issue' from a complex perspective. Whatever your views, the specific of illegal abortion are graphically, but not exploitatively portrayed. 4. One scene with a long close-up of Vera Drake's face which is an exquisite moment of cinema. 5. The handling of the sub-plots: 'Reg and Ethel', the two brothers, suburban flight. All of these are woven into the central story beautifully. 6. 'Lily'. Every British film needs a hatchet-faced, judgmental harridan. 7. Simple and beautiful cinematography. 8. The absence of unexpected and redundant plot twists used to manipulate the audience. 9. Jim Broadbent has a part in it."
106887,"Poor Script, Poor Dialogue, Poor Acting.  Avoid this.; Contains Spoilers Sorry I can't see how this movie was ever green lighted. I recognized a young Kirsten Dunst instantly. Written for very young viewers. Anyone older than ten will not put up with this crap. The continuity is awful, with many things (like Khonanesta somehow escaping being locked up in a shed), never explained. There is sloppy editing, lousy dialog, and poor acting to boot. Gunshot wounds that appear to bother the victims less than a mosquito bite. More than once, the poachers have a clean shot to kill the Kodiak, yet somehow fail to pull the trigger and let the bear attack them. The bear even chases 4 men with loaded rifles away from their camp. Hmm, come to think of it, if their gunshots were so ineffective, I would run too. Kirsten Dunst leaves her jacket in one direction while they escape in another, only to kick up dirt and gravel in the opposite direction so they could easily be tracked. A poacher shot with an arrow, in a scene that looks fatal, later re-appears later without a scratch. An old clue cloth (that looks plastic coated), with an insipid riddle that leads the way to a sacred Indian place. Writer/director Cyran's script may have looked good on paper, but the low budget, poor acting and bad direction make this a film to avoid. Interesting only to Kirsten Dunst enthusiasts (she looks very very young here) One Star"
30816,"After this, maybe it's Webber who should go into hiding!; I'm one of those that never saw the stage rendition with Michael Crawford but from all accounts the critics never considered it a great show despite it's huge success. The casting is interesting in both a good and bad sense with little known Gerard Butler cast in the title role as the Phantom. It seems that the Phantom has been teaching up and coming singer Christine (Emmy Rossum) the finer points of his genius in opera and after a falling out between the new owners of the opera house and they're current diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver) young Christine steps in and becomes the new star in town. *****SPOILER ALERT***** Christine's secret with the Phantom is known only by Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson) but when the wealthy patron Raoul (Patrick Wilson) starts to get romantic with Christine than the Phantom becomes head over heels jealous and his presence becomes more open to everyone. Joel Schumacher was chosen by Andrew Lloyd Webber to direct probably because of his diverse range of film projects in his career and like his previous efforts he has put together a lavish looking film but while it looks great on the surface this is still something that for me didn't work on any level. I do think Emmy Rossum is a major talent and considering that she was a real opera singer at the tender age of 7 than she seems to be well cast. Two of the biggest problems comes from the casting of Butler and Wilson since neither one of them generate much in terms of charisma, charm, or screen presence for that matter. We can understand Christine's curiosity for the Phantom but as far as romance is concerned it seems ludicrous especially after his mask comes off and his face is revealed. From that point on this Phantom is more of a pathetic stalker than the mad genius he's originally thought to be. The mask itself is more of a fashion statement and you had to wonder how it stays on. The songs are a big issue if audiences are going to enjoy this musical and for me I found them overly dramatic and unconvincing especially during the scene when Raoul comes to rescue Christine towards the end of the film and we are subjected to musical numbers with ridiculous lines such as ""Free her, I love her"" but basically the music is just unmemorable. The film looks good and there is even some interesting uses of color but other than that (and the talent of Rossum) this is a completely empty spectacle with some of the dullest actors cast in lead roles since Miles O'Keeffe in ""Tarzan, The Ape Man"" but I think the real nail in the coffin is that for a musical it's one that doesn't possess a single song that's memorable which ultimately leaves the film pointless."
30707,"Eastwood is Hollywood's Savior... 4 stars!!!; Million Dollar Baby is without a doubt a Masterpiece. It is One of the most powerful movies that should be mentioned in the same breath as films like , Godfather, Citizen Kane, Shawshenk Redemption, Schindler' list, Rocky, etc. Basically it should be in a top 15 List of all time already. I left the theatre around 2 hours ago, and I must say that I am still getting goosebumps thinking about the film....No spoilers here so don't worry. This is a film about a 31 year old with a dream. An old trainer living with guilt, and an old former fighter of the trainer who never knew what the word ""can't"" means. Character development? I can't remember the last time so much emotion was involved when I saw a film. Acting? great on the part of all 3 characters. This movie has to pick up a few Oscars along the way. Clint Eastwood has always been my Idol as a kid, mainly for his Western's and Dirty Harry was OK. His movies then were violent. Clint always regretted his earlier days how he was perceived as only an action guy. He does not want people to remember him for his violent past. Now he makes movies about Strength, forgiveness, redemption, faith, opportunity, and the straight impact all these words have on the audience. No body does it better than Clint."
30822,"I throughly enjoyed this movie; I throughly enjoyed this movie, as it brought together all the basic important elements in life. Family, Job pressures, changes in corporate management, and just overall human emotions and circumstances. It is rare in recent times that I have seen such an honest, down to earth, human movie which brings together life's important elements so nicely. My only criticism about the movie is that I didn't like the ending. I will not state how it ended due to the site's spoiler rules, but if there was one thing about the film I didn't like, that was it. However, overall, it was a very well done film, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good movie about family and real life issues, elements seen far too rarely in the movies nowadays. Mitch"
1222,"Hilarious and moving at the same time!; *****spoilers**** Before I saw this movie I expected a violent and moving film, what i got was a HILARIOUS film with superb acting(thanks to Vincent dnofrio and lee Erny)it was also moving in many ways like the suicide of gommer Pyle and the execution of one of the enemy's by joker.But what this film genuinely shows is that war is hell and that it screwed up so many peoples minds and thoughts,and since i'm only 13 it showed me the horrors of wars and the terror that soon follows it.One more thing if anyone ever see this skip the suicide seen because i can take any gore but that one seen has dramatized me beyond belief.But all in all one of Kubricks best!"
5183,"So this was Tom Hanks' first movie, so what? Get over it already; ***May be spoilers*** This girl named 'Amy' is having second thoughts about getting married to her prick of a boyfriend, and she starts seeing a man following her. She tries to tell her ex boyfriend 'Marvin' (who is desperate to get back together with her) but he doesn't believe her. As it turns out, this guy stalking her is a killer after brides to be after he himself was left at the alter years before. There is also a cop after the killer, since the same killer had murdered his bride to be three years earlier. Several of Amy's friends are killed along the way, and in the most memorable scene, one babe of a girl ends up decapitated and her head put in the fish tank! The killer finally finds Amy, she runs to Marvin who is working at the local morgue, with the killer giving chase, but then we get a really anticlimactic ending where you don't really see any resolution to the story. Marvin and Amy manage to lock the killer in a freezer just as the cops arrive ... and then that's it. When this movie tries to build suspense it works very well, and most of the stalking scenes are done in broad daylight, which is another point in this movie's favour since it avoided all of the clichés about a dark house/ basement/ attic/ closet, but it does end up lapsing into clichés several other times, like when we see a friend of Amy's having an affair with a college professor for no other reason than just to have a sex scene and ten minutes of filler material, and then, as I said before, the ending is just the obligatory set up for a sequel. A boring ending notwithstanding, this is still better than most of the other slasher movies that came out around this same time - including that horrendously over rated 'Halloween'."
77835,"This is a great movie.; This is a great movie, but not for any traditional reason. This movie, like Hollywood Canteen, was made to make money for the canteens (I don't know if it was just this one or a group or all). There is a slight plot to the movie. It is really a vehicle to see some of the great stars of the period do their thing. Gypsy Rose Lee does a G strip. If you don't like big band music or vaudeville style humour this is not for you. We watched last night on TCM and really had a great time. Picking out the stars was pretty cool. Helen Hayes we did not get until she was named. Several others we did not know. Harpo Marx was great and so was Ray Bolger. Edgar Bergan was Edger Bergan. If you don't like their style you won't enjoy them here. Katherine Cornell's Juliet dialogue with a solder was terrific and touching. Peggy Lee was great with Benny Goodman. We had the long version about 2 hours and 15 minutes. We stayed up to see how the sappy plots played out. We were that hooked."
30892,"the animation was really really annoying; well mary will weigh in on this question. yes Darger is an awesome subject and I learned things about him and was very grateful but I really couldn't stand the animation with voiceovers, it drove me crazy and to my mind the film gave a really pale impression of Darger's work. there are some really nice books about darger it's too bad they are all so EXPENSIVE, they really are, but a book is definitely the way to go, you get a much better look at the work that way. Incidentally I feel the same way about ""The Civil War"". Slowly panning over photos to give them ""motion"" and having all these walter brennen type central casting voices delivering quotes from history books I find a terrible use of the film medium. that doc also should have been a book with pictures accompanied by blocks of text! Anyway, at least the film brings attention to HD but as a film I really disliked it a lot."
8966,"A Nutshell Review: Kinsey; The movie's tagline says ""Let's talk about sex"". And it really does - talk. This is the other bioepic that opens this week in Singapore's shores (besides The Aviator), and it presents to you the life of Dr Kinsey, sex researcher, well, not by chance. Starting off as a zoologist with intense and devoted research on gull wasps, he discovers a necessity to research on sex, sparked by his own ineptness towards making love for the very first time with his virgin wife. As with all research, you need a sample population size to theorize. Collecting gull wasps is must simpler than getting people to reveal their innermost secrets and fantasies, as he painfully discovers. So there lies the opening of the movie, which showcases the methods of questioning he uses to get people to open up and talk about their sex lives. This is perhaps one of the highlights of the movie. And as with all research, you might need to dabble into the queer and the untrodden path. Here, we see him engaging in homosexual love, and in the name of science, unenthusiastically allowing his wife to sleep with his pet student (hey, he must be impartial and objective to his research), and fellow staff members to have sex with others' wives, and get it on film to be analysed! Impartiality and objectivity in research also takes centrestage - we're humans after all, with sets of morals that differ from person to person. How much ""deviant"" practices can one sit through when delving into other's intimate secrets? In one particular interview, the interviewee boasts to having committed incest, bestiality, etc! This film charts the rise (a topic that's ""new"", never talked about so openly, hence gaining Dr Kinsey fame), to the fall (societal backlash from challenging normal sexual conventions, mostly from popular nonacceptance and denying the truth about what's happening around society) of Kinsey's research, and through it, shows that when society's morals and conduct comes under the spotlight, not everyone can accept scientific findings with an open mind - ignorance may be bliss. This movie is stripped of erotica, so anyone who thinks they might have a field day with sex on cellulite ought to think twice. Watch it from a scientific point of view, and you'll enjoy the show tremendously."
2278,"A perfect action film from veteran Frankenheimer; This is an example of how great action film can be, it definitely has it all - an intelligent and interesting script made by David Mamet, some great actors led by Robert De Niro who gives superb performance as usual, and gets strong support from Jean ""Leon"" Reno. the action scenes are the most impressive I have seen in recent years, especially the car chases which are flawless. The story follows a bunch mercenaries hired by a beautiful Irish lady (Natascha McElhone), probably works for terrorists though that point isn't very clear. Those men are hired to get a valuable suitcase which we don't know what its content. The story is full of twists and surprises that will keep you at the edge of your seat and accompanied by smart dialogs (Mamet's trademark). The scene which De Niro's Character pulls out a bullet after he got shot is priceless. the filming locations are marvelous, especially those in the city of Nice. More than 30 years after his ""Manchurian Candidate"" Director Frankenheimer proves us that he still hasn't lost it. Overall a highly entertaining film that will please all of those who are looking for an intelligent action film. Highly Recommended 10/10"
32128,"Nice surprise; Well I was looking in my video shop for a 7 day rental (ie all those old films people don't want to watch any more), and was feeling quite hungover, so I didn't want to waste too much time. I grabbed this because I've always liked Paul Kaye, and can honestly say its one of the funniest films I've seen in years. I'm not usually a fan of British comedies, they tend to be a bit cheesy I think, but this was top class, I'm really surprised that no-one I know has mentioned it before. If your a fan of bowls, then this might not be for you, as it does take the mickey out of this age old sport. I was surprised to learn that it was (loosely) based on a true story. Some excellent cameos in it as well. If you've not seen it, see it. If you've seen it, good."
7077,"Fabulous and Frustrating; This enormously successful film lives up to its legendary reputation. But it's also disappointing. The atmospheric splendor of the cinematography and the melancholy mood set by the original musical score (on the Kino Video release) lull the viewer into the sense of reverie essential to appreciating this charming representation of countrified America facing the encroachment of big city evils. The story is well-told by director D.W. Griffith, and the moral message of Woman's spiritual virtuosity is exploited without the sermonizing of some of his other pictures. There is a sensitivity and naturalness exhibited in the unfolding narrative of Way Down East and a graceful style seen in none of his other epic-scale ventures. In bringing the sweetness of his famous one-reelers to a major feature film, Griffith captured an almost magical tone and ambiance that distinguishes Way Down East as a masterful piece of intimate storytelling, rivaling Broken Blossoms (1919) in its intensity and sheer beauty. However, it must be said that Griffith's sideline excesses in plot development are many and varied, hindering the progression of the central tale of Anna Moore's struggle to escape her past and search out a new life. Annoying bits of slapstick humor, totally at odds with the romance and tragedy of the main story, are indulged in while overly sentimental touches, like long, wistful close-ups, are equally aggravating. Though otherwise superbly acted by Lillian Gish (Anna), her role is marred by the fact that some of her more emotional scenes are unnecessarily drawn out by Griffith. This is particularly true in the sequence of the death of Anna's illegitimate newborn. Richard Barthelmess, as David Bartlett, Anna's sweetheart and savior, is outstandingly effective, as is Lowell Sherman as the decadent cad Lennox Sanderson who deceives Anna. Not all of the supporting cast was as competent or convincing, due largely to out-of-place comedic impersonations. One huge stand out is Mary Hay who leaps onto the screen with a refreshing vivacity. The wit she imparts to her small role is the only really clever humor in the movie. Long-forgotten today, but much discussed at the time, was the cameo appearance in the movie's prologue of popular New York society girl Mrs. Morgan Belmont, who played Diana Tremont, one of Anna's snooty Boston cousins. To do justice to her part, as well as to form an exciting contrast to the pastoral images to follow, Griffith went all out in the costume department, hiring top fashion designer Lucile (Lady Duff Gordon) to design glitzy gowns for the garden party and ball scenes. Despite some errors in continuity, Way Down East's celebrated climax of Anna's rescue from an ice-flow as it drifts toward a roaring waterfall, is perfectly paced and as thrilling as it must have been to audiences in 1920. Considering the limited special effects of the day, the scenes are amazingly realistic. Gish lying unconscious on an ice cake as it zooms to destruction, her arm trailing in the current, is one of the most familiar silent film shots, even to people who know next to nothing about the genre, and although it has become almost cliché, its power is undiminished. As a story, Way Down East is both fabulous and frustrating but its photographic beauty and emotional resonance are almost unparalleled in the Griffith oeuvre."
8784,"Somewhat tedious romance; I don't understand why anybody would give this movie a 10/10. OK, the acting work is adequate, the script contains some good lines and ideas (I liked the miniature pet cemetery and the scene in the boat) and the music is not as bad as one would expect. And I assume that younger people will recognize more of their own life and attitude in it than I do. But when I read that people liken this movie to a classic like ""The Graduate"", I wonder how they even can start to compare. I have nothing against Zach Braff, but he's definitely no Dustin Hoffmann (yet?) and even less a Mike Nichols. The romance between Large and Sam is quite nice, but it contains far too much saccharine. The ending of the movie is so disgustingly syrupy my teeth started to ache. Compare that to Benjamin and Elaine driving away in the bus without looking to each other: now that's an image one never forgets and what makes ""The Graduate"" a classic. Two minutes after the end I had completely forgotten what music what music was used in ""Garden State""; I just remembered it hadn't disturbed me much. Forgetting ""The Sound of Silence"" or ""Mrs. Robinson"" is nearly impossible, because it's really music that can change your life. I found ""Garden State"" sometimes boring, sometimes funny, and it's probably worthwhile watching it on TV while socializing with friends. But I wouldn't advise anybody to watch it in the theater or buy the DVD. Personally I would prefer to have my money back and not have seen this movie. But as Sam was really cute I'll give it a 4/10."
8782,"An enjoyable large-screen translation of the material from the original series; Thunderbirds is not a bad movie. The overall look (set design, costumes, photography) is actually very good and the special effects breathtaking (incredibly better than in most movies which today get raved reviews). The acting, the script and the direction is OK. No special feeling on the editing. Naturally, the plot by itself is simplistic and unbelievable but, come on, is not that the case for most big budget productions today? I personally find it unbearable when people who have nothing interesting to say try to sell their movies by repeating over and over to the press and future viewers stereotyped expressions like 'character development'; if you share this point, of view, Thunderbirds is a very honest and very entertaining movie. Another provocative remark: do you really think the plots of the Shakespeare plays are 'believable' (I naturally admit they are much richer, to say the least, than the plot of Thunderbirds)? A final point: for Star Trek fans, it does show that Frakes is importing stuff he learned while filming on the Enterprise bridges. You are free to enjoy it, or hate it. My rating: 7/10, if you take it for what it is meant to be. I hope this comment helps you."
31032,"The Last Horror Movie is Julian Richard's best movie thus far; Kevin Howarth (who horror genre fans should remember from ""Razor Blade Smile"") does a pretty bang-up job playing Max, a psychopath who uses the tool of video to record his violent episodes in this Julian Richards written and directed film (which too it's credit is FAR from horrible). I was supposed to see this film last year at the Philly Film Fest, looking back on that in retrospect, I'm glad that something came up, and didn't attend the screening. Not that it's a bad movie mind you. Quite the opposite is the case as I enjoyed it. Just that it works so much better on the small screen with one or two viewers as opposed to the big screen with a vastly bigger crowd. The film itself hearkens back to both Remy Belvaux's ""Man Bites dog"" and John McNaughton's ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"", alas not being as morbidly hilarious as the former, nor as darkly terrifying as the latter. That said it is a fairly solid film-watching experience that should be had at least once by any fan of the horror genre. My Grade: C+ DVD Extras: Commentary by Julian Richands and Kevin Howarth; 4 deleted scenes; Making of featurette; Cast auditions; a bonus short ""The Shoe Collector""; and trailers for ""Corn"", ""Gypsy '83"" , and ""Virgin"""
555,"Overrated, like Tarantino.; Don't kill me yet, let me speak, although Tarantino is good he is definitely nowhere near greatness, yet. Kill Bill was his best film (which i would give a 9 out of a 10), reservoir dogs was good, but far from great, a 6 out of a 10, Jackie brown was bad, and finally pulp fiction, one of the most overrated films ever alongside 2001 and Seven Samurai (both of which sucked terribly). Pulp fiction wasn't bad it just wasn't very good, just because the story was chopped up doesn't make it a good one, it was uninteresting and had ZERO action, also the rape scene and the dialogue were pointless, all they said was the f word and the rape scene was just wrong, if it had more action and a better story with better dialogue it would be much better, i would give Pulp a 4 out of a 10, so as you can see Tarantino is good but needs to do a lot more to become great. Now onto this movie, just let me say that this is Scott's film so give him some credit, Tarantino wrote it, Scott made it, all the performances and style are from Scott, he is a good director capable of just as much if not more then Tarantino. Overall this was an average film, basically a chick flick with violence, drugs, and great dialogue, a highlight of the film, the dialogue was creative an hilarious, and Brad Pitt cracked me up, he played the pothead so well, in fact he was a little too good, wonder what he was doing back then. It had style, it had humor, it had decent performances, but it lacked a complex story, action, and drama. I give it a 5 out of a 10, Scott has gotten better since this and i cant wait to see Domino, as for Tarantino i hope he continues making movies just as long as he makes them more like Kill Bill, he is good but don't think of him as a god because he is far from anywhere near that status, i hope he does Inglorious Bastards he would make a great war movie, also i would like to see his new kung fu movie, sounds good."
8907,"Oh my god it's full of stars!; ""Shark Tale"" is a very entertaining movie suitable for most ages. The acting is very good and the dialog is excellent. An unusual lot of stars in the cast who seems to have had a lot of fun in their roles. Will Smith is the same as always. The movies suffers mainly from three things: * Oscar, the main character, is somewhat ugly designed, looking like a dragon fish with a Will Smith-mask pasted on. Some of the other characters are also a bit too human-like, I'm thinking about the character Lola. She is as close to sexy as a ... fish ... can get, and fish aren't supposed to be sexy. * The soundtrack contains a lot of RNB and hip-hop. While I don't like these genres very much in general, in my opinion they are especially bad as movie music and makes for a lot of the movie to feel like a stereotypical RNB music video. * What with all the chairs and seats? Fish usually don't sit and it looks very uncomfortable when they do. The setting is fun, very similar to ""Finding Nemo"", except with a lot more characters, and city-like environments, involved. ""Shark Tale"" is slightly more cartoonish and pop-ish, and with more anatomically incorrect character designs. The cinematics and animation are beautiful and imaginative. The story is a standard ""things are bad/things get good/things get worse/things get perfect/happy ending"" story, not very unpredictable but both the comic and dramatic segments work fine together. No masterpiece but definitely not a waste of time. It does not really have the kind of ""soul"" that makes some movies lovable. I rate it 8/10."
3405,"The Definitive Account of the Titanic,  Told Through One of the Best Historical Dramas Ever Made; Based on the Walter Lord novel of the same name, A Night to Remember is far and away the most definitive and honest telling of this famous and world-shaking disaster. Flaws it may have, but these largely revolve around a lack of special effects technology available at the time, and a lack of historical evidence due the fact the wreck had not yet been discovered. Despite these minor quibbles, the film is probably the only one to loyally adhere to telling the truth about what happened that night; and it does so in a most compelling way. Unlike the smartingly awful James Cameron schlock boiler, ANTR doesn't pack a spectacular special effects punch - but nor does it pack a spectacularly corny and improbable love story concocted with teenagers in mind. The producers of ANTR understood that you didn't need a fictitious love story to heighten the tragedy of that night - the bitter irony of the real events sufficed. And it is this irony and tragedy that the filmmakers brought out absorbingly well. The comprehensive book by Walter Lord was consulted down to the letter; so the story is told as authentically as possible. With a great script involving mainly real historical characters, perfect casting, and performances that show the actors were engrossed in their roles, the film really does shine. The snappy, economical directing is both proof of the lack of pretensiousness of the producers, as well as being extremely effective in bringing out the meaning in each scene. This makes for intelligent and gripping viewing. Watch out for the poignant scenes in which the crew attempt to contact the nearby Californian to no avail, and Captain Smith walks to the railing and implores God to help them; the scene where the Captain calls ""every man for himself"", then walks into the wheelhouse just before it dips underwater; and the gripping scene in which Thomas Andrews (the Titanic's designer), a broken man, waits in the smoking room for the end, determined to go down with his creation. All these scenes are powerful, authentic and sincere; scenes in which all the various emotions aroused by such a disaster are brought out very clearly and movingly. The special effects, although not so brilliant for today, were fantastic for the times; half the ship was actually constructed for life-size shooting, and a large model was also built, complete with miniature little row boats featuring motorised oars, for the long shots. So the maximum effort was made to make as realistic a depiction of the disaster as possible. And, in fact, the interior scenes of the ship are perfectly authentic, and the audience feels that they are actually aboard the Titanic. Only in the long shots, where a model was used, does the film look noticeably dated. So by sticking as close as possible to the survivor's accounts featured in the Walter Lord novel, and by avoiding modern cinematic clichés, A Night to Remember remains the only Titanic film to provide a genuine account of the sinking of the great ship that is not marred by superficial Hollywood garbage. It tells the story, as it happened, of an event that changed mankind's attitudes toward his own creations; and as such, it brings to the screen the full impact of what this disaster really meant to the world in, as mentioned, a very compelling, poignant and honest way. It is a true testament to British film making. As a footnote, many actual survivors of the Titanic were on set as the film was being made; and the musical pig in the lifeboat scenes was the actual one from the real disaster. In addition, the Titanic's fourth officer Boxhall was a technical adviser to the production. And the film's producer was there, as a small child, when the actual Titanic was launched in Belfast. This kind of authenticity makes this movie almost a living documentary. Intelligent, honest and compelling, A Night to Remember is at least one of the best historical films ever made, and is well worth anybody's time. Everyone is bound to get something out of this movie; and indeed it is a powerhouse for anyone with an interest in the Titanic or just history in general. A totally underrated gem."
2520,"Greatest movie ever made!; OK, so it's not the greatest movie ever made. In many ways it is, in the words of movie critics everywhere, ""a big piece of junk."" Nevertheless, on a cold winter night with a tub of microwave popcorn and a cold case of nostalgia, I'd rather watch Airport than, say, Citizen Kane, or Potemkin, or Gone WTW, or any of the other so-called classics of the cinema. Everyone in this movie is so...tacky! So contrived! And oh so serious! People actually dressed in suits to fly on an airplane. Burt Lancaster never stops working, damnit, cuz running an airport is a full-time job. Dean Martin actually uses the adjective ""precious"" to describe jet fuel. Remember this was before OPEC, when the stuff was pretty cheap! Yet it's all authentic, in its own horrible way. Not authentic to real people and to a real story, God forbid, but authentic to an idealized way of life that people imagined I suppose as late as 1970, when this clunker was made. Why watch it now? Watch for the airport exteriors shot at a real airport---Minneapolis/St. Paul International--which does not look like this any more. Gone are the open-air parking lot, the gleaming white concourses, the tin and cheesecloth ticket counters. Gone with them are the silly notions that stewardesses are sex kittens in jolly nice uniforms, that real men smoke tobacco products on any and all occasions, and that nothing could be more glamorous than a Boeing 707 taking off for Rome. Especially gone is the era when a passenger could stroll aboard an airplane toting even a sewing scissors, nevermind what D.O. Guerrero was packing in that briefcase. Gone is the innocence of the uninspected life, an innocence this movie holds in spades."
8373,Waste of time; This film sucked. I had missed it as the cinema and was going mad to see it. I work in a video store so when i brought it home to watch it with my mam it was easy to guess I was shocked. What a great cast and what a great load of rubbish. Nicole Kidman is a fine actress. She annoys me sometimes but in general a fantastic actress. Bette Midler can act and is genuinely funny. Matthew Broderick hoped this was his stepping stone back into a leading man actor category...sorry Mr Broderick and Mr Walken now that I think about it..you both suck. I only left it on because I liked Nicole's hair blonde and erm I wanted to see the actual bad ending. Wait til it's on TV cause it is crap.
6808,"Scared of heights and Richard Burton.; Just wanted to say thatI just saw this film on TV for about the tenth time. And still enjoyed it. Wouldn't have bothered to write except it's a bit of a scary film for me - the first time I saw the Alps for real I froze and they were 15 miles away. Cablecars and Icepicks are... well... However - Mary Ure always drops my jaw as far as the Alps did. Beautiful women with submachineguns always float my boat. well.... Oddly enough Amelie is my fave movie. And she doesn't have a gun. Contrast ? Anyone know what Ms. Ure is doing now ? Love to all, Neil Morgans."
32213,"amazing extension of this building saga and mythos; The cube movies are the most inventive and satisfying creations in budget horror films today. The first film is still in my top ten list and is a destined to be classic. I was a little disappointed by the second film which took a much more of a sci fi turn. But this film returns to the grittiness of the first. Also being that we get to see the observers of the cube more, many connections (mostly to the first film) and secrets are revealed. Many people say that they didn't like this because it jumps around out of the cube so you can't really get connected with the people in the cube. But honestly, that story has already been done, to perfection in the first cube film. This film is more about the button men who work at the cube. This movie is awesome and is a perfect sequel to the original, and far more superior than the first sequel."
7153,"Caution- eye leakage may occur when watching this film; This is the most intense, moving and spectacular in the trilogy. Finally, a film to rival star wars. Peter Jackson concludes Tolkiens story in a fantastic battle between good and evil. However, i do have a few beefs with this film. For the fans of Tolkien, many were disappointed at not finding out what happened to sauruman or however you spell it. I was shocked that christopher lees scenes were cut but i wasn't bothered until i saw the extended version and realised how much i had missed! However, if jackson had kept these scenes in, I'm afraid wed probably all die of bum rot. every time i watch this film, i cry about a dozen times. its such a personal and moving film, we have followed these characters and you cant help but fall in love with every one of them. Jackson has been criticised for having a million endings, but he wanted to keep the story as tolkien intended. and I'm glad he did. its a beautiful heart warming story that you must watch, and see what all the fuss is about."
8360,"Fantastic; This is a brilliant film. simply brilliant. for young and for old, doesn't matter. It's fun for all in this flick. The extra sequence at the end is a bonus, featuring simon cowell, classic. When I first saw this film I hadn't even watched the original, so I thought that it would be a bit of a challenge to comprehend this sequel. Not at all. The sequel has plenty of pointers to direct new shrek fans as to what has happened in the first flick. Great music score helps with this fantastic movie. It just really made me wanna watch the original. Shrek 3 please........? Rating 9/10. Brilliant."
30816,"The Bestest Musical of All!; Although I've never seen the stage performance of The Phantom of the Opera, I've seen the film for about 4 times already in cinema. One might argue that it is a waste of money, but in my opinion, mere money is a little price to pay to watch such a mesmerizing movie. Musical lovers should love this movie. The scenery is awesome, especially the cemetery and the opera house. The costumes are really beautiful... it makes you want to live in that time in order to wear those wonderful dresses. As the film began, I became awe-struck with the way the scene changed from black and white to colour - it was as if something eerily magical was blowing on things and removing from them the years and the decay. The Masquerade scene is really fantastic - it makes you hold your breath till its end - the choreography is outstanding, as are the costumes. I really thought that Minnie Driver acted out her part really well, the stuck-up, demanding diva, to its best. Emmy Rossum really amazed me, with her wonderful voice and her excellent face expressions and gestures. Jennifer Ellison, although I can't say she really is a favourite actress of mine, really surprised me with a sweet voice and a charming personality well acted. Gerard Butler played his part to its full extent, with the phantom seeming mad, loving, sexy, intelligent and dangerous all at the same time. Patrick Wilson, or Raoul, played his part well although to some, he might seem a little bit soppy. However, he is still charming and any girl's knight in shining armour. I particularly liked Miranda Richardson's part as Madame Giry. The mystifying air around her makes her more interesting to the viewers. The best scene, in my opinion is the one where the phantom takes Christine to his dungeons. The effects are stunning. Another song which I did not expect to be so beautiful and meaningful is ""Point of no Return"". It's provocative and shows the phantom's spell over Christine. The only thing which really disappointed me was that the lip-synching wasn't that great, especially in ""Think of Me"". On the whole, I really loved this musical. It's a must-see for all musical-lovers. Above all, I think that you either love it or hate it."
31878,"The Ultimate Kung-fu Movie; Wow... Sorry, world, but there's no need to ever make another kung-fu movie. ""Gong Fu,"" or ""Kung Fu Hustle,"" combines every classic element of the genre and takes it farther than humanly imaginable. With mindblowing CG effects, wire work, fight choreography, acting, editing, score and (ultimately) directing, the film is able to be absolutely hysterical yet certifiably epic and moving. If you don't believe me, just look at the whoppingly disproportionate amount of 10s this flick received from obviously hardcore kung-fu mavens who've seen it already. Personally, I thought Matrix One set a new precedent for the action movie, and was vastly disappointed with the sequels. ""Gong Fu"" properly fulfills the destiny of action-movie evolution, as well as make you wet your pants with laughter."
6584,"One of the few Woody Allen films that doesn't work for me; Woody Allen gives a Japanese-directed James Bond-styled actioner a new soundtrack, including different dialogue telling a new story. Allen's changes turn the film into a spy versus spy quest for the recipe of the world's best egg salad. I'm a huge Woody Allen fan. The idea behind this film is promising and the basic premise of Allen's story, grafted on to a pre-existing film, International Secret Police: Key of Keys (Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi), from 1965, by Senkichi Taniguchi, is funny, if silly. However, this is one of the very few Allen films that just doesn't work for me. The Taniguchi film seems chopped up to a point of incoherence (maybe it's presented here in its entirety and in the same order, but that would mean that its running time is around 60 minutes or less), although that could be a factor of the changed dialogue. I found myself wishing there was an alternate soundtrack that was a legitimate dubbing of the original film. Although there are a few very funny scenes, one-liners and ideas in Allen's new story, most of it isn't very funny. Too many scenes seem like they may be serious translations of the Japanese dialogue. There are too many occurrences of silly vocal noises, but not enough to make that a motif so that it's funny. There are too many long sections where the film is mostly boring. The untranslated beginning goes on far too long. The mini-interview with Allen that explains the film's premise would only be funny if it weren't true. The Lovin' Spoonful scenes aren't funny, and perhaps weren't intended to be--they seem like a studio attempt to try to put more butts in theater seats upon the film's release by featuring a popular rock group. It doesn't seem like Allen spent much time on thisthe dialogue seems largely improvised and mostly disjointed. In short, the film is basically a mess, and only worth viewing for Woody Allen completist, and men with a serious Asian woman fetish (it's also worth noting that Taniguchi seems to share a foot fetish). What would have worked better, and probably would have made the film much funnier, is if Allen would have written and directed both the film that we're seeing visually and a completely different story for the soundtrack. Much more time would have to be spent crafting each component to make them seem unrelated but coherent and funny. That's an experiment that remains to be done, to my knowledge. There are enough positive aspects that the film doesn't deserve a 1--as I noted, there are times that What's Up, Tiger Lily is funny--but the best I can do is a 5 out of 10."
32015,"Over the top enjoyable; Four actors, disappointed at not getting the role of Jesus in a new play, hit the road for Broadway to audition for a revival of Jesus Christ, SUPERSTAR. They don't get very far. (Not a spoiler.) From the utterly unique Von Piglet Sisters comes this spoof of over-the-top exploitation films that is even farther over the top than the films it spoofs. GORY GORY HALLELUJAH sends up road movies, motorcycle movies, sexploitation films, zombies, ancient curses, musicals, serious legitimate theatre, actors, directors, producers, trite camera angles, inventive camera angles, relationship movies, relationships, religion, Elvis impersonators, Elvis, preachers, down-home rural-crazies horror movies, gross-outs, and everything else that's sacred. People who love Troma will love this film even more. An instant classic of its genre."
6288,"Sad, almost fantastical journey but manages to have realistic undertones; For me, the movie was one of the few movies that was Asian-cast or even teen-oriented that spoke to me about the hardships of being an adolescent in high school. Although I am not longer near the age, I felt a connection to the characters in the movie. I relate very much to the main character, Ben. I think the movie showed the pressures of living up to a stereotype - that is, being Asian, getting into a great university and being smart. Some say this movie promotes stereotypes, perhaps it does, but it is done in a telling and important way. For example, like how many Asian people carry a beeper/cellphone. But the important one being how many Asians feel hard-pressed to be academically brilliant, and it is something that transcends race, to something that is felt by all students. I would have liked it more if it did focus more on such things. A very interesting character is Daric, who plays one of Ben's friends/partners-in-crime. His demeanor is amazingly calm, cool, collected and chillingly real. It makes you question the morality of certain MTV-generation children and how much one is able to disregard or sacrifice in order to appear respected and smart. This is perhaps a new version of Stepford wives. And it makes you think about the implications of societal expectations on adolescents. Parents hardly if ever, make an appearance in the movie. I can't seem to recall to say with certainty. Neither are many authority-figures. I did not enjoy that, as I found that somewhat unrealistic, because without the motivators, where is the motivation? *slight spoiler* The problem I had was with their ""connections"" in their illegal dealings and what-not. It seemed a little improbable, seeing as how would one find time to do such things and keep up straight A's. So that was a bit of magic realism in the story. So if you can suspend your belief, it works out quite well. There is a bit of controversy surrounding the casting of the Asian characters by people of different Asian races. I think that it was even foretold by the scriptwriters, as the ""true"" races of the characters were never revealed, but everyone just assumed they were part of the ""Chinese Mafia."" All in all, a very interesting, albeit sometimes unrealistic film that skims the surface about issues of race, the lengths one would go to achieve good grades, awkwardness of crushes and jealousy. The films presents questions as to why, but never actually attempts to answer them. This is both bad and good. You can be left feeling either satisfied or empty. Perhaps because the answers to the questions are too broad, complex, multi-fold or there are no answers, only questions. Perhaps we all do things with knowing why."
27584,"Nightmarish (spoilers); Imagine driving down a lone, desolate road. No turn-offs, no stores, no houses, just a straight road leading no where. You pass the same sign again and again. If you try to go on foot into the woods, you'll just end up on the road back at the car. Your family begins going mad. Getting picked off one-by-one by something. There's no escape. OK, the first 15 or 20 minutes are TERRIBLE--bad writing, acting, stupid jokes...but then, it gets good! the acting, especially once the two annoying male teens are killed off, improves greatly, the writing gets better and best of all--the suspense! The tension between the characters builds quickly as they unveil hideous secrets about themselves and as they begin getting killed by a ghost-like entity. First-time writer/directors Jean-Baptiste Andrea and Fabrice Canepa deliver an atmosphere that flawlessly conveys the characters intensifying sense of dread. There are a couple of gruesome gore scenes--there's one moment where a guy gets his lips bitten off that really made me cringe as well as an effective scene where the back of a woman's head is scrapped open, revealing her brain. But the film doesn't rely on gore--which is fine by me--and instead focuses on suspense. There's very little in the way of pop-scares, most of them are subtle and sneak up on you and their very, very effective. Of my few complaints here is that the ending is highly unsatisfying, I won't tell you what happens but I was disappointed and all the suspense that I expected to build and build until the end then explode came out as nothing more than a mild fart. And then of course you have the scene where the teenage boy...well, if you've seen the movie, you know what scene I'm talking about...eeww... A very good, dark, unexpected treat, if you can sit through the terrible first 20 minutes you'll become highly intrigued. 7.5/10."
7090,"Film offers a new aspect in beauty and storytelling; Starting with Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" cinema has a new genre to deal with and even though we have all seen martial arts films before the way they are now made has become so visually stunning that even those who are not fans will be hearing more about them. The story here revolves around a nameless assassin (Jet Li) who has come to the King of Qin (Chen Daoming) with his version of how he killed the three assassins that have attempted the Kings life. Nameless starts out 100 yards from the King but as his story is scrutinized he is allowed to get closer until he is only 10 yards away which may or may not be what he wants. *****SPOILER ALERT***** The story involving the 3 assassins are shown in flashbacks with Broken Sword (Tony Leung) working in calligraphy that he believes helps him in sword battles. Assassin number two is his mistress Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung) and Long Sky (Donnie Yen) being the third and since Nameless knows of their skills he uses psychology to try and defeat them. Broken Sword has an apprentice named Moon (Zhang Ziyi) that figures into the circle and adds to Flying Snow's suspicion of her so-called colleagues. Zhang Yimou has made a film that is clearly reminiscent of Kurasawa's ""Rashomon"" in the manner of the narrative with the characters giving different accounts to what may have happened with the three assassins. Yimou's films are different from anything else that I have ever seen and from the ballet-like martial arts to the beautiful uses of color his films are elevated from casual viewing to being a movie going experience. Li is exceptionally well cast and reminds everyone why he became such a big star in his country and the ease in which he performs some of the martial arts sequences is very evident. There are so many breathtaking scenes that take place that it would be impossible to describe them all but it's hard to shake the images of the battles like the one on the surface of the lake, the leaves blowing in the forest, the green sheets hanging from all sides, and the storm of arrows raining down. If I have to quibble it would be the confusion of what story is true and which one's are not but aside from that this is one of those visually stunning films that helps open the door even wider for a new style in the martial arts genre and gives proof that Yimou is one of the worlds more talented directors."
8983,"Chinese close-up torture; -- mild spoilers -- The beginning is quite beautiful and entertaining, although it lacks - as I had expected from Zhang having seen his ""Hero"" - the light-hearted fun that was typical for the beloved Hongkong New Wave Films, when it was the physical skills of stars like Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh that was most important for a film, not some expensive special effects. What follows then in the second half of ""House of Flying Daggers"" is simply unbelievable: an endless series of incredibly dull ""dramatic"" love scenes. Toward the end, there is a short cut to a group of soldiers approaching the hideaway of the ""Flying Daggers"". Of course we expect to see the grand finale, the showdown between the ""Flying Daggers"" and the soldiers of the emperor, but - nothing happens. The film just ends. What is Mr. Zhang trying to say? That it doesn't matter who wins because only the love story counts? Or did he run out of money? There are very rare glimpses of humour in the dialogue, and at approximately 96 per cent of the shots the director seems to have forgot that he was shooting on CinemaScope. This was easily the worst martial arts film I have ever seen."
111538,"no breakfast at Tiffany's.; I admire any movie that tries to change the language of film, even though such efforts nearly always fail. 3-D was a fad that was almost never used properly ('Inferno' being a rare exception). Smell-O-Vision and Odorama were never more than stunts. 'The Door in the Wall', with its fascinating use of Dynamic Frame, proved too unwieldy for exhibition on a large scale. 'Wicked, Wicked' was filmed in something cried Duo-Vision ... which means that, except for the opening credits, the entire film is shown in split-screen. Now, split-screen is a valid story-telling device when it's used intelligently and sparingly. A great example is in 'The Silence of the Lambs', during the exciting sequence in which Clarice Starling and a team of FBI agents are going to two separate houses simultaneously. But 'Wicked, Wicked' has two things happening at the same go for the *entire* movie. Sadly, one of them is (mostly) irrelevant, and the other one is painfully trite. SPOILERS COMING THICK AND FAST. At the beginning of the movie, we see a woman seat herself at an organ and begin playing some Phantom of the Opera music, which she continues to play throughout the film. She's dressed in an elaborate formal outfit that would be appropriate for a concert-hall recital, yet she's all alone. Also, the actress cast in this role is so spectacularly ugly that I couldn't believe her looks were coincidental. I was positive she was going to turn out to be a supernatural witch, or something similar. No; her looks *are* irrelevant. In fact, this woman and her organ music are completely irrelevant. She sits there fingering her organ through the entire film, yet she never interacts with any of the other characters, nor do any of them seem to hear her organ music. The scriptwriter just wants to have *two* events occurring simultaneously (for the sake of the split-screen gimmick), so we get this irrelevant organ recital. The main plot concerns a resort hotel in a remote location. The very pretty Tiffany Bolling arrives as a black-haired nightclub singer who's been booked by the hotel. Her black hair doesn't match her fair complexion. Um, but some nutter is killing brunettes, so the local cop decides she ought to turn blonde as a matter of self-preservation. Bolling spends most of the flick as a blonde, and looks much prettier with long golden locks than with long raven tresses ... but she looks a natural blonde who was pretending to be brunette, not the other way round. The identity and whereabouts of the psycho are no mystery, as we watch him (on one-half of the split-screen) through most of the film. Randolph Roberts plays a disaffected youth whose mother was mean to him, so now he's just gotta go slicing pretty girls. Guess who he's picked out as his next victim. Tiffany Bolling is no actress, but she's so damned pretty that I kept watching. Still, it's painful to hear her singing this movie's awful title song 'Wicked, Wicked ... that's the ticket...' on one side of the screen while Roberts flicks his knife on the other side of the screen. I kept expecting the old Warner Brothers cartoon gag where the character on one side of a split screen reaches across the partition to the other side. Character actress Madeleine Sherwood, whom I've always liked, is stuck here in a pathetic role as a sub-Tennessee Williams dowager who has fallen on bad times, and is desperately trying to avoid eviction from the hotel after her money has run out. If you're waiting for this subplot to link up with the psycho killer or his blonde prey, keep waiting. Soon after this, Sherwood's acting career declined to the point where she ended up doing low-budget commercials for Hansel & Gretel cold cuts. I used to confuse Madeleine Sherwood with silent-film actress Madeline Hurlock, who married playwright Robert Sherwood. 'Wicked, Wicked' is written and directed by Richard L Bare. Despite this film, I've a lot of respect for Bare's career. He had extensive film and television credits -- including the entire run of 'Green Acres' after the pilot episode, plus some classic 'Twilight Zone' episodes -- and he also wrote an excellent textbook on film directing. He was probably hoping that 'Wicked, Wicked' would be his prestige hit ... but it's just boring and pretentious. I'll rate this movie 2 points out of 10: one point out of kindness to Bare, and one point because Tiffany Bolling is so sexy."
40010,"Terrific Film!; I just saw Duck Season today at the Palm Springs Film Festival and loved this film. People of all ages were in the theater and we all were laughing throughout the film. This film was great on all levels. I liked that it was filmed in black and white which was a nice touch. The actors were great. The story was fantastic! The director did a great job with the creativity of this film. I marked ""Superb"" on my ballot. This film needs to be released!!! It would be very popular due to its artistic flare, and people want to see movies that move them in all directions which this film does. A funny, creative, playful, thoughtful film! Thanks to all who made this film and shared it with us! Roxie Roco :)"
128646,"Good....but..... Not Good Enough .; Yes,this was quite unfortunately Ms. Hepburn's last,1st billed,starring vehicle. What a shame it is too! Despite a daring storyline and plot about elderly people who no longer want to live,the second 1/2 of this film gets hopelessly lost. It loses it's direction and in a sense...chickens out from it's bold stance on assisted suicide and or mercy killings. While I don't favor such acts,I thought that Ms. Hepburn and all involved were making some sort of statement here. Later she,regrets her act of helping her friends die by turning in the man she hired! The continuity of the film seems disrupted as well by shoddy editing and dialog. At least she got to be in 1994's Love Affair and her TV movies were even better. A short appearance for Love Affair, but 100% better than this. In one part of this Nick Nolte is looking all over the city for her and incredibly finds her on the roof of a building! What did he do? Go to the roof of every building in the city? By the end of this I can't tell if they regret what they've done or are okay with it. When I originally found this at my local Blockbuster Video, I considered it a stroke of luck but I guess I should have known by how dusty it was (and yes it honestly was!)that it hadn't been watched for a reason. I love Ms. Hepburn's acting and I don't blame her for this fiasco nor Mr. Nolte. She's great as always but the second 1/2 does no justice to her abilities. I blame the writers,the producers,the directors and the studio especially, for not shelving this embarrassment to an otherwise great actress. Avoid at all costs,unless you ""really"" love Katharine Hepburn so much,you'll watch her in anything! (END)"
103598,"Hail to the King of Hamlets.; Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grace the stage and captures every inch of the character. Every nuance and element of Hamlet is depicted and depicted well. Some people have complained about his age, but you honestly cannot tell when watching the film. If anything, he looks drastically younger than 40. I only wish a more worthy Ophelia could have been found. Her acting is passable but she just doesn't look the part. The only real exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, who is a great Claudius. The rest of the cast is good, but Jacobi is what truly elevates this teleplay."
1584,"This movie makes the Universe itself seem shallow; This movie is hopelessly inept, which is a shame since it initially promises entertainment AND enlightenment. We root for Dr. Arroway, the strong non-sexualized female scientist/protagonist. All is crushed, however, by the weight of solemn movieplex convention: shouting into the wind, unfolding steadycam vista with soaring soundtrack, eccentric billionaire and nefarious black shoe, and technology so shiny it resembles a high-end cosmetic counter. Ideationally, the movie has all the intellectual courage and wisdom of a Howard Hughes anti-commie second feature of the fifties starring a semi-sober star in retrograde. More specifically, the faith vs science argument is propped up, referenced, alluded to, and even enacted (at times), but nothing is resolved in a meaningful way. We learn that space is very very big, space travel is like a waterslide, that ancestor worship can pay spiritual dividends, and that science is very similar to religion, in that both can be overlaid with sloppy sentimentality and imbued with supernatural talismans of womblike delight. This movie makes the universe seem shallow."
27793,"a film of two halves; i picked this film up cheap on DVD not long ago, mainly down to the fact that the 1st movie was a blast, mindless gory sci-fi fun...iwas pretty much hoping the sequel would provide the same thrills...did it? yes and no let me say, the first half of this movie is pretty dire, it involves the small fleet of soldiers trying to fend off the bugs from a base they've taken refuge in, whilst there they release a prisoner (+ expert soldier) who was kept at the building. It's all kinda crap, bad acting, no real story, it's all abit boring. I thought at this point id be flogging this DVD on ebay as soon as it finished, then... the 2nd half of this movie friggin rules, a story starts to unfold and the gore levels go through the roof. Suddenly this film is a lot of fun...some of soldiers you see are affected by bugs, and they who are want to infect the rest of the crew, queue some really cool special effects and some bloody death scenes and this film has suddenly been saved. Avoid the ridiculous OTT heroic ending and you'll be OK. still this ain't gonna be for everyone, i think some people will give up on it in the first half hour, but don't! hae patience with it and you might start to enjoy this film as much as i did. 7/10...fun gore, cheese, fun!"
30810,"work of genius; This movie is spectacular. to start, the script is Andersons strongest and most imaginative work yet. I loved the dialogue, the slight swagger the words gave bill murray(who was awesome). the directions was almost directed like a play... which works so well. The cutout for the belefonte, that follows from room to room was perfect for this movie. the acting was extremely strong in this movie. This is an ensemble movie, but some performance that stood out were Bill Murray(he is the greatest living actor today, IMO) Owen Wilson( his death scene was so sad, yet Owen played it with such class and dignity, something i never have seen from him before) Angelica Houston( she was kind of bitchy but in a loving sorta way and was still able to come off classy), Willam Defou(effin funny... Anderson and him should do more work together), Jeff Goldblum(who is hysterical as well in this movie). and the music was perfect... all the David bowie covers were great, and the ping island theme was so funny, when bill murray danced and it just fit the movie perfectly. the only thing i would complain about is more of the music and the sea creatures... both were incredible, and i wanted more, especially from the observation hole... would have made this movie a bit more vibrant and fantasy like, but still its an awesome movie and I would still give it an A. I didn't think if Anderson could top himself after the royal Tannenbaum's, but i was wrong."
3948,"Jay Roach has taken his Austin Powers cartoonism too far.; This is one of those films that was advertised so heavily, I felt like I'd seen it before I actually saw it. They used all the best gags in the ads (which isn't saying much) and the presence of De Niro dominated. Maybe it's just me, for I know this was a big hit, but I couldn't stand seeing a highly regarded actor like Robert De Niro mugging his way through this lowbrow flick like it were a 108-minute Saturday Night Live sketch--which is what it should have been. It is staggeringly annoying watching Ben Stiller endure thinly veiled threat after threat, and it's not even rewarding when he finally stands up for himself. Judging by this films box-office take, I guess I'm not in the majority when I say I am sick of the whole ""you're not good enough for my daughter"" schtick in movies and TV (the dreck known as ""8 Simple Rules"" is another example). However, I would like to thank IMDb for this website which allows me to vent my extreme displeasure at this totally unoriginal and irritating trend. I found this ""comedy"" utterly awful. P.S. If you agree with me, you might want to check out the Roach's previous film, Mystery Alaska. I wish it had been a hit, and Roach were making more subtle comedies like it today rather than succumbing to using easy gags and pandering to mainstream taste."
116167,"The Movie That Made Barbara Stanwyck a Star; 23 year old Barbara Stanwyck became a leading film star in 1930 with the release of LADIES OF LEISURE, after having starred in two flops in 1929. This is a very slender story of a good time girl who falls in love with a millionaire's son who basically is just interested in her as a model for a painting he wants to do. Given how free-wheeling and blunt most early talkies were on morality, this movie is surprisingly discreet about Stanwyck's character's past. We are supposed to read into the story she's a prostitute (or more accurately, a former mistress) - but in her first scene she is fleeing a yacht party that's too risqué for her!! Stanwyck rings honesty out of a cardboard script and she's got good support from three second-tier silent stars who are quite good in talkies - Ralph Graves as the object of her affection, Marie Prevost as her wisecracking, less prudish pal, and especially Lowell Sherman as Graves' drunken buddy who is very open to being Stanwyck's next sugar daddy yet the best scene is the confrontation being Stanwyck and Graves' mother, superbly played by a somewhat unsung character actress, Nance O'Neil. The movie's minor fame today rests on it being Stanwyck's first screen success and an early hit for director Frank Capra yet Capra's direction is rather dull and often awkward and the movie is very badly edited with some scenes conspicuously made up of different takes with shot angles and acting rhythms off among other giveaways (to say nothing of the scene where Graves answers the phone and says ""Hello"" way before the receiver is anywhere near his mouth!!) As mentioned by another reviewer, a ""silent"" version of the film was also shot (the smaller studios like Columbia were still making silent versions of some of their films up to 1931 for the ever dwindling number of movie theaters that were still not wired for sound), I don't know anything about the silent version being available on video and not the sound film, possibly the silent version fell into public domain and that's why that version alone is on tape, however the sound version still exists and was shown on American Movie Classics in the early 1990's back when that channel actually showed classic movies. Turner Classic Movies, on the other hand, has so many MGM and Warner Bros. films at their disposal they hardly need to go elsewhere for films so it's not likely they will bother to pick up rights to this movie from Columbia. I wouldn't be surprised, however, one day to see it and a number of other early Capra talkies together in a boxed DVD set given his legend as a director."
138540,"J.T. Walsh is reason enough to see it; This neo-film noir is one of a genre of late twentieth century American films that all seem to involve corrupt characters, fast cars, a ribbon of highway and, of course, plenty of guns wielded by people who appear never to have taken a gun safety course. The actors are the best reason to see ""Black Day, Blue Night."" There is the late, great J.T. Walsh (""Swing Blade,"" ""Pleasantville,"" ""Red Rock West,"" ""The Last Seduction,"" and many more), who did many neo-films noirs (See also ""Breakdown""). Then there is Michele Forbes of the TV series ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" and ""Homicide."" (In a supporting role, there is even the late Bejamin Lum who also appeared on a Star Trek episode titled ""The Naked Now."") A spoiler of sorts--a clue really: Only the most innocent survive, but innocence is a very relative term in a movie like this, and you probably won't guess who is innocent before the final reel."
132222,"Karloff at his hammiest; Obviously it helps to be a connoisseur of ""B"" horror films to enjoy this and I have to admit that I am one of those that can find entertainment in cheesy low budget films especially one like this that has a bit of irony to it. Story takes place in Germany where a film crew is making a movie at the Frankenstein castle where the last descendant of the infamous family needs money so that he can complete his ""work"". Baron Victor von Frankenstein (Boris Karloff) is badly scarred from the Nazis and he dreams of having his old face back which is part of his work in his hidden laboratory but of course he's also trying to bring to life a monster that he has built himself and to complete this the film crew unknowingly helped him buy an atomic reactor. *****SPOILER ALERT***** Baron Frankenstein still needs body parts to complete his monster and after his butler Shuter (Norbert Schiller) accidentally stumbles upon the laboratory the Baron uses his brain for his creation. Others in the film crew start to disappear like the script girl and the cameraman and this makes the director Douglas Row (Don ""Red"" Barry) very nervous to where he notifies the local police who look around the castle and find nothing. The Baron has had his eye (the good one) on the star Carolyn Hayes (Jana Lund) and needs a certain part from her but the monster remembers her kindness and rebels against his orders. This film is directed by Howard W. Koch who worked primarily as an assistant director and producer but occasionally he did venture over to the directors helm. There are so many things that I noticed as I watched this and the first would be the crew-cut that Karloff wears to remind everyone that they are supposed to be in Germany. Karloff's performance seems to be a gross characterization of roles he's played before and along with the facial scars and a nose worse than Jake LaMotta he badly imitates a limp. Karloff practically drools over actress Lund and then gimps his way into the other room to play organ music and I was reminded of ""Mad Monster Party"" after viewing this. Lund wears this skintight shirt that makes her bosoms stick out like torpedoes and after she gives the seemingly virginal butler Shuter a scarf and kisses him on the cheek he seems to be in dire need of changing his shorts! I also noticed that at night when Karloff was in his laboratory making a whole lot of noise with his atomic reactor nobody woke up or heard anything! Barry who plays the director wears these ""mama boy"" pajamas with polo player designs on them as the others are sitting in their rooms getting drunk or trying to sleep. The monster is played by Mike Lane who starred in ""The Harder They Fall"" with Bogart and his creature is completely wrapped up in bandages which makes him appear more like the mummy. If you read these comments you might think that I didn't enjoy this but your wrong. I found this very entertaining from the low budget atmosphere to the bit of irony that's revealed when they take the bandages off the monsters face and we see an unscarred Karloff. I'm not sure if the writers were trying to be ironic but it seems to be just the right touch considering that Karloff played the role in 1931."
8783,"Ultimately an excellent movie, weighed down by great expectations; Great masterpieces are often god-given to the lucky, ONCE a lifetime....It would seem unfair if the ""once-a-lifetime"" rule was not enforced. Unfortunately for M. Night Shyamalan, his masterpiece was the ""Sixth Sense"" and it came at an early stage in his life, personally and professionally. The village brings out the writer/director's uncanny ability to challenge the senses, but it still won't break the ""once-a-lifetime"" rule for the director unfortunately. Nevertheless, ""the Village"" is the ""Love Story"" for the 2000s; what can u say about a M. Night Shyamalan movie that cant be classed as a spoiler? whilst we don't get a foul-mouthed beauty in Ali Macgraw, we do have the innocence beauty of newcomer Bryce Howard. The two things that the movie lacked when compared to the 1970s favourite is the awesome musical theme and the tragic ending. At some point in the movie, M. Night Shyamalan ""the romantic"" killed M. Night Shyamalan ""Hichcock-wannabe"", and thereafter ensued a need to explain to the audience everything that needed to be explained, whether it was needed was debatable. The turning point might have been when Edward Walker tells his daughter ""not to scream too much"". At this point in time, we are lead along the path that the father is willing to send his blind daughter alone into the forest, no matter how just the reason may be, knowing of certain death and ""not to scream too much"". At this point in the movie, we are gleefully happy to pile hate on the father and cheer the courage of the young girl. Unfortunately, the path M. Night Shyamalan subsequently takes ""surprises"" everyone, including the horror-buff crowd. M. Night Shyamalan ""the romantic"" brings the ""twist"" forward. And despite having a few minor twists later, the ""twist"" brings the audience back into their seats, when at that particular time, they were immersed in ""the Village"". And it would seem a jarring experience for many critics. The acting for the great cast is overall adequate, but none particularly award-winning. Newcomer Bryce Howard, needs to learn how to act ""blind"", to sense the world with her hearing rather than her sight; to her credit she grew into the part, acting blind rather than acting a cripple with a cane. ""Love story"" 1970 didn't have great acting either. And like its predecessor, ""the Village"" tries to have a cultural defining tag line too. ""Sometimes we don't do things we want to do so others don't know we want to do them"". Prententious? perhaps. M Night who has an ethnic background brings a cultutral sensitivity rarely seen on American films. The Village is ultimately about culture and cultural identity, myths, and religion: the things people do to survive in the world, the mechanisms for survival. And of course the power of love. Overall the Village is an excellent movie, highly recommended. Perhaps if the director had stuck to the styles of his earlier works, it would have been better received."
31221,"Awesome, Electrifying, Spine tingling; This movie exceeded my expectations! I went to see it with my sister and am going back to see it with my husband. We laughed, clapped, sat with mouth wide open, cringed. This movie had absolutely every thing a classic should have. It is definitely a movie we will own and one that I will enjoy watching over and over and over again. A ""must see""! I wish I could tell you all the incredible details, but I don't want this to be a spoiler. Jennifer Garner did an amazing job at playing Elektra. She was exciting in DareDevil . . . and I think this was kind of like a spin off, though DareDevil isn't in this movie at all. We got to see how Elektra came to be, how she grew up, what ticked inside her head. This made the movie touch your heart . . . so you knew why she was doing what she was doing. It drew you in and made you want to know her more. And the three men behind us said ""ooh and aaah"" every time she came out in that red fighter number of hers. I think they were scared to death of her, too! ha ha Have fun enjoying this movie!"
8983,"VERY, very, pretty...; 7 out of 10 stars... This movie was super eye candy! Great costumes, great settings. The fashion...the dancing...the bamboo groves...the woods...the fields... Yummy!! We had some trouble laughing at parts of the movie that were not supposed to be comedy. But we still had a great time! The fights/action were good and there were some misty eyes by the end. When the lights went up the crowd seemed happy. I went to the movie with a open mind and no expectations. If I had gone thinking the movie was more action based I might not have been so happy. **********SPOILER BELOW*********************************************** The worse, most funny/not meant to be funny laugh, was at the end when Mei sat up from the snow. The whole crowd did a caught off guard belly laugh!! The ending was almost too much/over the top and yet not enough... Still I will give it 7 out of 10"
128634,"Hitchcock-lite; The ""Invisible Ghost"" isn't exactly terrible or B-quality camp, but it isn't great, either. As said by other reviewers, the film moves very slowly, even at the points of suspense and climax. The story doesn't seem to reach a level of intensity in which would put the viewer at the edge of his seat... and the story is a little absurd. A lot goes unexplained (or seems unnoticed, in this case). (MILD SPOILER in this paragraph.) I think the story would have been a lot better if the entire story kept the fact that Lugosi's character was the murderer a mystery, because not even he knew who was the culprit. However, the viewer does, as it all plays out in front of our eyes. But, as usual, like any other Lugosi vehicle, he gives it his all. In this picture, his character is a tad more mellow and not as out there and intense as he is in other pictures. And it's a little nice to see him play just a regular guy for a change. So he's not type-casted TOO bad in this one. If you're a big Lugosi fan, this is one to put on the bottom of the must see list. If you're not a fan of Lugosi, this movie might not do much for you. Like I said before, it's not campy or, on the other end of the spectrum, it's not a ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Godfather"", either. I don't think there are any good quality reproductions of this movie on DVD anywhere. I got a copy on DVD from a local grocery store on DVD for $2.00 and it's a little less than average (especially on the audio front). So, good luck finding a copy if you REALLY need it. 4/10."
3739,"27 men, none get on base.; I've viewed the film three times, and it is as near to perfect as one can get.  Get it right once, and you never have to prove yourself again. Unless you want to make Shop Around The Corner and Ninotchka and To Be or Not To Be.  Sheez.  He's basically like the Dickens of Film, and this one is the crown jewel."
31221,"To each his own opinion.  And, in my opinion, this movie kicks super butt.; *~May contain spoilers~* 'Kay, first off, I already knew that Jennifer Garner could pull the role of Elektra off. I mean, when she stabbed the dude on the roof with her sai...that was bloody brilliant. I loved that scene, and I am still thinking about it. It had a nice amount of action, though not enough. I would've loved to see Jennifer in the signature outfit more than twice. Also, with how the villains were thought up, that was also nice. I liked how Elektra kept having flashbacks of her mother's death, and how the image of Kirigi slowly sifted in. The fighting was incredible. The actress who had the privilege of playing Abby Miller was awesome. I read this in another review and, yes, the colors are absolutely terrific. The lip-locking scene between Typhoid Mary and Elektra was beautiful. I mean, the detail of how there was a ring of dead leaves around Elektra. Truly remarkable and artistic. The feud with Typhoid and Abby was great, too. The one problem and the only problem with the movie is that the villains, such as Kinkou, Stone, and Tyhpoid, died WAY too quick before they could be more appreciated. So, if there was a second installment to Elektra, then I would definitely go see it, if it was fixed up a little bit more. Jennifer Garner did an excellent performance and is remarkable as Elektra. Well done to the cast and crew. 9/10 Definitely worthy for some things such as...""Best Villain"" and ""Best fight scene"". And, actually, the director deserves an award. His dedication to this movie and his confidence paid off. So, yes, to each his own opinion. And, in my opinion, this movie kicks super @$$ like no other. I didn't even really like Blade, X-men 1 and 2 (geek of both)or Catwoman this much. They were all great movies, in my opinion. But, still, Jennifer won my heart as Elektra. She was brilliant. So, if you're going to go see this movie, then go see it. And, for goodness sake, do not waste any of your time reading gruesome reviews. Because, trust me, that's the only thing that you will wish you didn't waste your time on. GO SEE ELEKTRA!!!"
8783,"Sociologically fantastic; This movie absolutely blew my mind. I grew up in a small village in Central Illinois. My village is on the map solely because of the Amish community which has established itself in the rural area around the town. ""The Village"" is reminiscent of all things strived for by the Amish community. Whilst ridiculed by many and misunderstood by most of the rest, the Amish and the community in ""The Village"" long for the same things: a return to simpler times when the good in life was much more prolific. Although it could be argued that the members of the village have their ideals based upon and rooted in fear, that doesn't differ drastically from many ideals held throughout the world. The negative aspects of our ideals may not be as obvious and spelled-out to us like those of in ""The Village,"" but they remain similar none-the-less. ""The Village"" is a real thinker's movie and I commend M. Night Shyamalan for another remarkable movie. I can't wait to see what's next."
4344,"Greatest Movie Ever!!!!!; This movie was great!!!! Kudos to Travolta and Jackman for making this movie so watchable. The best thing about this movie is the realism that all the stars showed. Halle Berry is amazing in her role as a supposed undercover agent or not? If you are debating whether to see Lizzie McGuire movie or Swordfish, You shouldn't even have to think about it!! Swordfish is the ultimate choice for action flicks. Because it isn't to gory or sexual , even though there is some nudity. In my rating, I give swordfish 9 and a half out of ten, 9 been excellent and 1/2 been a little bit silly. Good luck with this movie."
6953,"how to make a arty movie; i'm sorry but i really disliked this movie. If you watch carefully this movie, you see it's just your average soap-opera but the writer decided to cover up the over-dramatized thin story by mixing all the scenes in a random order, only the end was put on its classical place. The cast : I think Sean Penn is much better on a director's chair (except his role in Woody Allen's ""sweet and lowdown""),Benicio Del Torro didn't convinced me as well and Naomi Watts ... no really... i had the feeling the director was waving with a academy award behind the camera. Is bringing together random characters by unfortunate events becoming a new genre ? Because i think we've seen it all now, don't we..."
7175,"Horrible Horrible Movie.; I sat through this film on a flight from Japan, they edit cursing etc out on these flights usually they should have just cut this whole movie. Watching it I didn't know if I should laugh or cry. I forgot there were biker gangs in Inglewood I guess living in the Ghetto getting crotch rockets is the thing to do...... This flick had no plot, crap dialogue, Crappy actors, and even worst SFX and action scenes, Fredro Starr should join his Onyx mate in the next Leprechaun sequel because Fredro is a notch below Cube and Cube should stick to making Friday because those are the only watchable movies he has made outside his work with Singleton. How this got made I don't know I thought Biker Boyz was bad then I saw this. Will Yun Lee is now on my avoid list as I have seen him in two of the more crappy movies in recent Theatrical release history Torque and Elektra. Joseph Kahn stick to making Britney Videos."
8640,"Utter rubbish; This is what happens when the man who did Pearl Harbor tries to do anything else vaguely historical, I guess. Absolute leaping tripe, from the wooden acting and appalling dialogue, through the preposterous sets (everything just plonked down in a boggy field) to the Saxons *invading from North of Hadrian's Wall*. I'll not mention the faux-martial-arts fight scenes or the tribe of ""Woads"". Only Ray Winstone's Bors comes close to making this enjoyable. You can see that there is a lot of talent that has been Hollywooded and committeed to death here. It's a very sad thing. Avoid."
8529,"Possibly Spielberg's worst movie; I have seen most of Spielberg's movies. I loved some, and I felt others were barely OK. But I was embarrassed to watch this one. I think this is his worst movie, by far. Compared to 'The Terminal', 'Minority Report' plays like 'The Third Man'. The movie is naturally technically perfect. Why was it made? I speculate the movie wants to be a very subtle and noble piece of art concocted to denounce the oppression of a pure but honest European guy by the cold and not humane American administration. The end result is so simplistic and exploitative that I found the movie simply insulting and hateful. The only word which comes to my mind is trash. As for Tom Hanks' acting, which I usually love, well...no comment. A final note: the character of C. Zeta-Jones ends up fulfilling all clichés about (female) flight personnel; does not that say it all? Do not degrade yourself by watching this movie."
4139,"Very underrated film; This film is nearly 20 years old, but still rates as one of the best movies I've ever seen. Following the title sequence which sets the violent scene of car crime which forms the backdrop for this film, Peter Werner opens the film with a fairly protracted scene featuring the central character (22-year-old rookie cop, Benjy) in his home environment. This marks the start of some brilliant characterisation which underpins the whole film, causing the viewer not to perceive that there is a ""villain of the piece"". As an enviable friendship between Bengy and the police target, suspected ringleader and businessman, Ted Varrick (Charlie Sheen) develops, the viewer yearns to be in ether's shoes, as Ted welcomes Bengy to his world of the ""rich and aimless"". This envy is part based on the complex hedonistic and idealistic relationships between all the characters that evolves, but ultimately everything relies for its roots on Bengy and Teds crime sprees, something that ultimately must end. The deterioration is palpable, and when ultimately the reckoning comes, it does so in series of twists that drive the two friends together (something very much cunningly engineered by Ted himself). The end represents a self fulfilling prophesy that left me craving for more, yet knowing there could be no sequel. The contrast between the pair is very much a focal point, the only commonality being their devotion to their own goals - goals which for Bengy at least become very blurred, as Ted gives him the Porsche and the lifestyle that form the focus of his own existence. The domestic opening scene is a stark contrast for the remote, empty but undeniabley plush and palacial house that Ted ""visits"" rather than truly lives in, with its stunning view from the hills over the city. The film is bolstered by some spectacular car chase sequences that are plausible in a way that modern sequences rarely are. They all involve Porsche 911's and if there is ever any incredulity it comes from these sequences only. Could an Oldsmobile ever keep pace with a works Porsche? How could an Iroc Z ever hope to keep up, and if it did, and crashed into the lightweight Porsche, how on earth does it fail to leave a scratch? Romantic interest is enticingly present as Ted encourages the relationship between Bengy and his own sister Anne (Lara Harris) but it never manages to rival, nor is intended to rival the strength of the bond between Ted and Bengy. Utterly brilliant for the most part, I've now watched this film 8 times. Thoroughly recommended."
6808,One of the best adaptations among Allistair Maclean's novels; A highly entertaining world war II action film with two of the greatest actors of their time at a high point of their career - Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. The first hour or so is the setting to the action that will follow: a group of American and British soldiers is sent to a castle where the Natzis are holding an important American General. The plot of course is not that simple and has a lot of spins and surprises that accompanied by a fascinating action scenes (Very impressing for a 1968). With a beautiful filming location at the freezing landscapes of Germany and Austria this movie is truly an amazing to watch. Notable sequences are the cable car sequence and the final escaping sequence. Richard Burton gives his usual strong performance and Clint Eastwood is good as his executor. All in all a well crafted action classic that is highly recommended. 10/10
83326,"As good as a circus gets; This isn't the first circus with a story I've seen, but its the best. No animal acts, clowns in minicars or individual stand alone performances, this sort of circus is highly stylized with a usually vague story, singing and music to blend one act after another. Some of the performers come from long lines of family acts, but there's also a fair number of Olympic caliber athletes looking to work their talent outside of competition. The acts are not all great, but are at least good and a few are exceptional. I thought it was pretty amazing that they are all done flawlessly in front of a live audience: Not one dropped prop, clumsy trip, dorky fall or wardrobe malfunction. I'm not often drawn to the artsy/pouffy sort of humor. It tends to be too French for me, and it just doesn't appeal. Not all things French, just their humor. Any sound effects resembling gastrointestinal activity are apparently the ultimate comedy. The least appealing parts of Varekai involved that same French humor, and knocks the score down a little. I enjoyed the other comic acts in the show, whether they were French or not. You can't beat a live circus show, but there are some advantages with watching this one on a widescreen. It was shot in HD format so it naturally takes in wider shots, and there's many angle shots, overheads and closeups that the live audience would never see. Colors are almost oversaturated but thats because so much of the circus is in bright primary colors. Varekai even has a DTS soundtrack and employs all the 5.1 system to good effect. The 2nd disc has some bio info on the performers and a short on getting selected and training for a live performance. The DVD set comes in a foldout box within a box, and gets an 8/10."
8972,"National Treasure; This film, in my opinion, is a mixture of many different but oddly related things. Tomb Raidor, Indiana Jones, The Da Vinci Code, Ocean's Eleven... you could go on forever. It's got the adventure of Indiana Jones, the over-exaggerations of Tomb Raidor, the riddles and cryptology of The Da Vinci Code and the criminal techniques of Ocean's Eleven. In my opinion, a rather odd combination of elements provides the viewer with an adventure, offering suspense, adrenaline, awesome scenes, gone-back-in-time-feeling and obviously, the romantic part has its say inevitably! Although the story is quite exciting and attention-grabbing, it is really quite predictable and the characters are stereotypes. There's the do-all-good hero/victim, the beautiful woman he has, at first managed to make her loathe him and then, after wowed her with his noble act, the funny adorable friend, the unapproving affectionate father and of course the bad guy, who is as usual filthy rich and reckless in what he does to win the fast-pacing race. In spite of these stereotypes, it is a rather enjoyable film. I would say that it is a film in which you need not think very much but sit back and relax while the story moves on. The ending is predictable, but rather amusing. Although it's nothing new, it's a fun film, which riddle-loving, adventurous person would love."
176571,"The best of the post, but avoid the Italian DVD; So, here we are. This movie, in its theatrical acception is one the best ""Fagioli Western"" I ever seen. I know it, pratically line by line (like the Alexander's Army...:)), and is funny exact like the original. If someone thinks that is poor in script is, imho, wrong, because everything is perfect. The gags are still funny, except for one or two that better in the original but, after 33 years (i wrote this in 2005!!) they still works, also better than in some Hollywood craps...the real problem is in the Italian DVD (manifactured by Medusa, owned by the Italian prime minister...:((). The first thing is there are a lot of missing scenes, including one ""Leone-Morricone"" trumphet one, that was in the original theatrical, that was quite more than 1 minute long!!!! It was placed after the restaurant and before the one when they meet the bad guys boss that offers them money ""to keep eyes closed"". Maybe was a scene too much political (infact, if my memory is not wrong, was about the people's conditions in the village). The other missing scenes are placed, with perfect video restoration and a ""mysterious"" bad audio, in the ""Cut scenes"" section of the DVD. I cannot believe! This is a very bad thing. When the movie passes on TV the scenes are all at their places (is more than 3 minutes of unnecessary cuts!). Why on DVD this bloodbath? So my rate is 9,5/10 for the movie and 5/10 for the DVD. We want the original ones. Thanks"
8984,"The beauty of Peter Andrews's work; I enjoyed the 90 degree sideways shot of the airplane landing, it tracks the airplane as it moves ahead, and on the other side, the camera is sideways again. The last movie I did, I use some upside down POV shots... maybe I should try this takilid camera angle some time... I've also wondered early on why the film had to show Toulour very diligent practicing his graceful dance - the scene juxtapoused when most of the Ocean personnel are busted. But later on it is payed off very amusingly. He makes the sign of the cross and... just watch the movie you'll see what I mean. I'm n0t sure how much I will give this movie out of 10 yet maybe its cos I'm slow, but Peter Andrews (alias ni Soderbergh's) cinematography is just EXCELLENT. Lingaw sad tong mga telephotos sa mga Ocean's 12 as they were let out of prison. And Julia Robert's character Tess - what role was she supposed to play? Just watch the film. And see a very amusing cameo from ... well, just watch the film. Will there be an Ocean's 13? Maybe not. But will Toulour be more successful? I will say no more. I hope this doesn't spoil anything."
4294,"Gotta love Hans ...; as the wicked Dr. T.! I wish I could find and see this flick again. Haven't seen it for more decades then i'd like to admit...but I remember it well, considering all of the damage done during the years in between and now! the scene that sticks with me though - above all others, is the guy in the drum! Man, what an image that was! hope that's not a spoiler. Nah, has nothing to do with the plot or storyline...just one of the many interesting, bizarre and well done visuals in this movie. But, hands down (pun intended) Hans steals the show just as he does all of those little fingers. Don't ask why.. its great entertainment and that's enough! I think that any one that studied music, specifically the piano, can relate on some level with this movie - in fact - even if you didn't - you can still see the kid's point of view of music lessons being a bit of a nightmare. Which is my personal view on the psychology behind this film. It makes the reality of music lessons so nonthreatening that if you had been dreading yours you could laugh it off now as being at least not so bad as this kid's had been."
3697,"Pumped-up sequel, dumb but watchable; PREDATOR 2 Aspect ratio: 1.85:1 Sound format: 6-track Dolby Stereo SR (35mm and 70mm release prints) Given that the original PREDATOR (1987) was little more than a routine potboiler, expectations could hardly have been lower for this pumped-up sequel, in which the eponymous alien beastie - a super-intelligent being, able to render itself invisible, amongst other things - arrives in LA of the near-future (1997) during an outbreak of gang warfare which maverick cop Danny Glover is struggling to contain within his jurisdiction. When various gang members fall victim to the aforementioned predator, an ultra-secret government agency (led by no-nonsense Gary Busey) wrests control of the case from Glover, who becomes personally involved when his partner (Ruben Blades) is torn to pieces by the alien fiend. Glover is a little too old for the kind of macho heroics displayed here, though his commercial profile was on a high at the time, due to his appearance in the hugely successful ""Lethal Weapon"" series, and his professional approach to the less-than-stellar screenplay is mirrored by an equally talented supporting cast, including Maria Conchita Alonso, Robert Davi, Adam Baldwin, Calvin Lockhart and a young-looking Bill Paxton as the rookie cop who has a memorable encounter with the title creature on a fast-moving subway train, the movie's pièce de résistance. As the monster, Kevin Peter Hall suffers manfully beneath Stan Winston's extraordinary makeup design, and Morton Downey Jr. (gag!) cameos as a sensation-seeking news reporter. Stephen Hopkins (THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PETER SELLERS) directs the material with a glorious disregard for subtlety or logic, and while the results may be too loud and obnoxious for some, it's fast-moving and completely unpretentious, despite levels of violence which probably pushed the boundaries of the R-rating in 1990. Followed by AVP: ALIEN VS. PREDATOR (2004)."
111368,"Plot-holes big enough to drive a truck through, plus lots of implausibilities; ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This story had great potential (young salesclerk wrongfully convicted of stealing gets sentenced to 3 years in prison, then emerges from prison seeking revenge on her boss and the prosecutor who sent her to prison). However, the execution of this story fell far from reaching its potential. Mary shows up at her prison pal, Aggie's, place. Aggie, too, is freshly out of prison, but based on her clothing and surroundings we see she is doing well. Aggie has a couple of other ""gang"" members with her (including Joe Garson, head of the gang). Mary shows up, looking like a skinny wet kitten in need of taking in. Thus begins Mary's association with this ""gang"". Joe takes Mary to his place and it's pretty clear that he's willing to take her in and take care of her in return for her providing him with sex. He realizes while trying to kiss her that she's a virgin, then respectfully backs off and gives her some money for a cab. This is just the first of many implausible scenes between Mary and Joe. Unbelievably, Mary goes from scared little waif to implied head of the gang in a matter of scenes. Also, somehow the apartment she showed up at when looking for Aggie has turned into ""Mary Turner's apartment"", as one of Joe's goons says when he answers the phone. Later in the movie, the police refer to the gang as the ""Mary Turner Mob"", but I'm getting ahead of myself. The first scam we see Mary, Aggie and Joe pull is extorting $20,000 from an old man for writing love letters to ""14 year old"" Aggie (right - Aggie looks about as much as a 14-year-old as I do!). The old man's lawyer drops $20,000 on the coffee table and turns to leave. ""Oh no, take your marked money with you. We'll see you at 4:00 in the lawyer's office and do this all legal-like"" Mary says. We see Joe's eyes bug out when Mary says ""marked money"" ... incredibly this naive virgin waif is all of a sudden more street-smart than longtime hoodlum and gang-head Joe?! I just had to roll my eyes! It's never explained how Mary got so savvy, and why Joe turns operations over to her ... I guess we are to assume she ""wised up"" during her 3 years in the Big House and Joe, still full of admiration for Mary for her virginity as well as her smarts, willingly lets her start calling the shots. Who knows -- that's the best explanation I can come up with based on this poorly developed script. In another scene, we see fur-drenched, sophisticated Mary show up with a young man at his apartment. The young man brought Mary to his lair with the intent of pouncing on her and getting a little piece of her. She's still a frigid little virgin, as he suddenly realizes when he tries to kiss her (just as Joe had earlier in the movie). All of a sudden, Little Lech Junior turns into Mister ""I'm Soooo in Love With You"" when his virgin Mary grabs her coat and heads for the door. As a little aside, Little Lech Junior (who we only later learn is Robert Gilder, son of Mary's ex-employer and the man responsible for sending her to prison) treats his Asian servant like something other than human, even referring to him as ""yellow peril"" at one point. I know there was no such thing as political correctness in 1930, and I have little patience for most things PC myself, but come on! Even in 1930, that had to have been distasteful! I'm probably running close to my 1000-word limit, so let me just wrap it up by saying the ending was schmaltzy and improbable and left me bitter at wasting over 1 hour watching this dreck. Mary and Robert Gilder (now man and wife) are at the police station, being questioned for the murder of a police stoolie. Joe Garson did it, but with his long criminal record, if he gets arrested one more time he's going to the chair. Mary and Robert try to protect Joe by claiming Robert shot the man in self-defense. Joe, seeing how much Mary loves Robert, doesn't want to ruin HER life so he confesses to the police that he did it, knowing full well he's going to the chair (riiight!). Mary is crying, upset that Joe is going to fry. Joe and the police lieutenant share a knowing look and nod, as if Joe is saying ""tell her I'm not going to the chair, so she won't be upset"" and the cop nods in assent. ""Aw, don't worry Mary, Joe's not gonna fry"", or words to that effect. Mary is still crying, but clearly relieved. Of course we know full well that Joe *IS* gonna fry. Fade out, ""The End"". Puh-leeeze. Good performance by Joan (a little hammy at times, but what JC performance isn't?), as well as Marie Prevost who played Aggie. You might want to watch it once, if you don't mind wasting 1.5 hours of your life. Otherwise, stay away. My rating: 3/10"
8983,"Skip this movie.   Wait for video, buy, then burn it.; I was very surprised how bad this movie was. Nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far. I was hoping for a rerun of Hero, but this is much, much worse. This movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place. No believable characters (even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies, these characters are ridiculous), virtually no plot, and ridiculous story twists. This movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child. Every time you think your silly battle makes some sense, they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense (""Ah ha, you only think you've got me with your super powers and 10,000 ray guns, but I ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon, so your ray guns don't work and I'm invulnerable to your super powers....tap tap no trade backs infinity PLUS one."") Children can continue with this lunacy, because they don't really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time. However, for the VIEWER, especially the adult viewer, this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas. SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung fu movie makers, (a) if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on PCP, in which case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall on your back, which has a knife in it, it will hurt more and do more damage, unless it is a fake prop, (c) when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife, you die, especially in ancient china where there isn't a Kaiser Permanente around the corner, (d) kung fu fights don't last for hours while 3 feet of snow falls, and (e) sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivations. In any event, go watch Hero again, because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible."
6874,"A piece of boring, annoying and worthless trash.; How such a film got into the top 100 list is beyond me. In Kill Bill (Volume 1), a bride-to-be/professional assassin (Uma Thurman) is shot by her boss, Bill (along with several female assassins) on her wedding day. All guests attending her wedding are killed. The Bride is the only survivor, but is incapacitated by a coma for five years. When the Bride awakens, she swears vengeance on everyone who put a halt to her life. In a time full of vengeance film, this has been by far the worst. The Director, Quentin Tarintino went to great lengths to make this film nothing more than a corny bloodbath. I do not object to violence and gore in cinema, but this was too much. Too much for me to handle, in laughter. Watching the Bride go Rambo on hundreds of Yakuza lackeys did nothing but make me laugh, at the stupidity that was being shown to me. What little story this movie did have was horrible. Corny one liners littered this film, only making it worse. (Just listen to one of the villain's lines, I won't state it here, as to avoid spoilers, but if you have any respect for cinema, you'll hate it). I need not write something about the actual plot, there is hardly one. I liked Jackie Brown, this was just a disappointment."
8951,"Tough Roe To Hoe; Having been concerned that Mike Leigh was 'borrowing' liberally from Claude Chabrol's 'Une affaire de femmes', which won Isabelle Huppert a Best Actress gong at the Venice Film Festival, and having admired the bulk of Leigh's work, both stage and film, I tried to approach this as neutrally as possible but ultimately I found it disappointing. Vera is portrayed as a sort of cockney Mother Teresa, practically too good to live and Leigh spends a good 20 minutes or so limning her goodness and willingness to put herself out for others before the delayed revelation, almost thrown away and with no build-up, that she is, in fact, an abortionist. For some reason the period detail fails to ring true and it's almost unbelievable to depict a society (1950) in which EVERYONE is happy or at least content, not a protester or whinger in sight. As if that weren't enough the music - ideally the music in a film should be unobtrusive - practically cries out 'listen to these sombre cellos establishing gloom'. The acting is certainly adequate but no more than that and Staunton, for all the hype surrounding her, is definitely not in the same league as Huppert. Okay, it's watchable -just, but don't miss Bowling For Dollars to catch this."
30818,"One of the best!; Beyond the Sea is Kevin Spacey's birthright! Spacey is Bobby Darin in this movie, and perhaps it could be said that he plays Darin better than Darin. I had the opportunity to see Bobby Darin perform in Vegas, and while he was a spectacular performer and exhibited a bigger than life persona, there was some little thing missing that could have made him another Sinatra. Spacey must be Darin's soul brother, because he manages to breathe life into the real Bobby allowing him to be the warm and caring person he was. He always seemed to be a bit stand-offish, and perhaps for good reason. Spacey peels away the layers of anxiety, sadness, and aloneness in a man who was more of himself than he really needed to be. It was something that Darin tried to do, but didn't do it near as well as Spacey. Excellent directing. Excellent musical performance. Excellent acting. It should have received a Golden Globe nomination for best movie in a musical category."
30816,"A movie of rising stars - wonderful and mesmerizing!; I am a big musical fan and phantom of the opera is my second favorite Broadway musical after Les Miserables. I had seen the Phantom of The Opera several times on stage and hesitated to see the movie until I realized that Andrew Lloyd Webber was heavily involved in it (Some of you may remember the horrible movie adaptation of Les Miserables starring Liam Neesam and Uma Thurman!!). The movie was mesmerizing, the music and singing sublime. I actually thought Gerard Butler was the best Phantom I had ever seen (and yes, I did see Michael Crawford on stage, so don't shoot me). He played the phantom with such an intensity, it took my breath away and drove me to tears. While you never get to see much of his face, he dominates the screen with his charisma. The chemistry between him and Chritine (Emmy Rossum) vibrates through the screen. Emmy Rossum was fabulous, just fabulous, as Christine. She managed to convey innocence, beauty, courage and fear so exquisitely. And boy what a voice! I was dumb founded when I realized she was only 16 while making the movie. She's definitely established herself as Hollywood's most promising new star. Patrick Wilson made Raoul more memorable, more solid and more alive than I can ever recall him to be. The theatrical performance has always left Raoul more on the sidelines. In the movie, he has a larger role and he portrays Christine's lover and protector with fervor. It does not hurt that he is also a very handsome man. Thumbs up to Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson. I'm glad to see directors beginning to tap into Minnie Driver's comic ability after her guest role on Will and Grace. And while she did not sing in the movie, she also has a beautiful voice that can be heard in the song ""Learn to Be Lonely"" at the end of the credits. While I loved everything about this movie which I have seen 3 times so far, I think it was inexcusable that the lip synching was so badly coordinated, especially since all the songs were performed by the proper characters (except for La Carlotta). I would have expected more perfectionism out of Joel Schumacher and Webber. Apart from that, it is an A+++ all the way. Please go see this movie. If you liked the stage performance, you'll love the movie."
8947,"Not so bad, rather good; I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought tickets and then checked the reviews at IMDb. I worried about seeing a bad movie. Well, I had fun watching the movie. Some parts, which obviously were meant to be scary, were actually quite humoristic, almost as in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I don't consider this a bad movie. It's not a great movie either. Just a rather well made horror movie. It does not rely heavily on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, music. In my opinion, the acting was OK. Sarah did a very good job, quite convincing. The other actors were definitely not bad either, I liked Yoko. The sets are nice (and I don't care that the sets are the exact same ones that were used in the Japanese original). The scary moments were often predictable. But not always. I have seen quite some horror, and did not expect to be scared now, but it happened at least twice. Nice. The movie had some nice scenes that were almost original, like the trails of rubbish, the simple special effects for he ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the cat that made eery noises, the gurgling of the dead boy and his mother. Don't go if you want to see Sarah in another Buffy episode, because it is very different from her Buffy work, much more serious. Don't go if you only want to see movies that gather Oscar nominations. It's a good horror movie, enough suspense. I gave it a 7."
6754,"What Kate did.  Oh dear look what Kate did next..; I had the misfortune to endured 15 minutes of Underworld last night. Not even the lovely (but talent less) Kate Beckinsale in Leather could hold my interest. I kind of liked the Vampire V Werewolf theme (When I was reading the synopsis in the telly guide), but the acting was terrible, the characters unbelievable and the plot absurd. To be fair, perhaps it improved as it went on, but I doubt it. A master class with Laurence Olivier wouldn't have improved the acting in this movie. I would be the first to admit that Kate Beckinsale is a babe, but her acting always leaves a lot to be desired. They say she is good in the aviator. As I haven't seen that film yet I can't comment but really all this lady is eye candy and shouldn't be a leading lady in any movie. Sorry Kate, but the truth hurts and she gets paid big money to deliver and seldom if ever does... I can accept Vampire firing silver bullets to kill Werewolves, but werewolves firing bullets mad of sunlight to kill Vampires? Give me a break.. And this technology was developed by pre-historic werewolves living in dirty cellars under subway stations. So avoid this movie, you will be glad you did...."
34045,"Could have a better ending; The movie is about Simon, who finds himself waking up in a Hospital room after a car accident. The doctor tells his name, the date and that his wife is waiting outside. But... what... I have a wife? Isn't it the year 2000 instead of 2002? Who's Mr. Travitt? And so on, this is how the movie goes on. We see the struggling of Simon from his inner perspective, in a 'Beautiful Mind' style, jumping back and forth in time 'The Butterfly Effect' style, meeting people he does not remember to know them 'The Bourne Identity' style and watching himself from the outside doing things he doesn't willing to do. At the beginning, it was interesting to me to do these jumps and to figure out the whos, the whys, but after the first half of the film, I just got tired to keep track of. I hesitated whether to stop watching or go on and finish and wait for the clue - finally I went for the latter, but what I got was under my expectations. It made me remember to the ending of 'The Others', just no so polished and not so shocking, in fact, it was sort of predictable as we got closer to the last scene. What is more, it wasn't really clear to me, what actually happened, why we had these time travels, how the peaces of the puzzle should really fall into place. However this was not because many questions were left open, but the storytelling was dubious. I couldn't decide whether this is a thriller, or a psycho-drama. This is a pity, while the movie would be about to take the journey with the main character, Simon, and solve the mystery with him, to be an entertaining thriller the storyline should have been more complex, to be a psycho-drama, characters and Simon's inner process should have been more sophisticated; the film was not boring to me, but not exciting either. The movie seems to borrow from many other good movies and tries to adapt and integrate on its own style, but to my opinion finally fails at that and the result is just digestible to me. If this had been the first film I see of this kind, I would have been excited, however, I have already seen a number of much better titles. Acting in the movie is average - though not outstanding, but OK for this kind of movie; pictures and shooting were acceptable, too. There is no sex, but a some amount of blood and violence. I rate it 5/10, it brings the entertainment like watching an average episode from the X-files."
8666,"Pitiful; I'm tempted to write a long piece explaining why this film was so bad, but I can all too easily summarise by saying ""Everything"". It was poorly acted, predictable, unenthralling, clichéd nonsense. And that was just the first half hour, at which point, for the sake of my brain and stopping it melting with the sheer tedium, I walked out of the cinema. If you're genuinely sad enough to believe that paying good money to see Halle Berry in a PVC suit is good enough reason to spend time gawking at this trash, then fine. Who am I to try to persuade you to try and do something more valuable with your time, like base-jumping without a parachute? Utterly abysmal"
8666,"Stupidity overload; Okay. There's been a lot of debate in the comments on whether this movie is as poor as some claim. I'm one of those people who say it is. I do not think this movie deserves even its current rating. There's this thing I can't stand in a movie: A line or an event of extreme idiocy or stupidity. It's like someone stabs me with a needle every time something simply too stupid happens on the screen. A typical blockbuster has a few of these, Catwoman had a years worth. The movie is incredibly stupid. The characters are stupid, the dialogue is incredibly stupid, the action scenes are stupid and the entire scenario of the movie is truly stupid. Stupid. In addition, the direction is horrible, Halle throws her worst performance I've seen to date, other actors are awful and the movie has no ""atmosphere"" to speak of, it feels incredibly pretentious and poorly written from start to finish. Absolutely dreadful. 1 point for the outfit and the laughs."
5219,"Another Disappointing Movie With Zombies; What is it about zombie movies ? The Romero movies had good scripts but were let down by the technical aspects while LIFEFORCE and 28 DAYS LATER were brilliantly directed but had woeful scripts . I thought after watching the first ten minutes of RESIDENT EVIL someone had got the balance right with the opening hook featuring some impressive novelty deaths . The problem is after this good start the movie then spends the next forty minutes going nowhere . We know what's going on because most the audience is aware of the computer game so we have to put up with some seriously uneeded exposition about Alice , the combat team and the Red Queen computer system . What makes it all so annoying is that you're left with the impression that the producers wanted the movie to appeal more to a mainstream audience rather than fans of the game then at the very last minute abandoned their initial instincts There are a couple of good aspects that stop RESIDENT EVIL being a total flop , it's good to look at on a visual level while a mainly British cast do manage very convincing American accents , and not all the main characters survive ( watch out for those lazers ) which makes the movie unpredictable . But again I have to point out the movie would have worked better still if the producers ignored the fan boys and made a movie with a wider mainstream appeal . As it stands perhaps the 1970 DOCTOR WHO story Inferno is the greatest piece of fiction featuring zombies"
8798,"fun action flick, but lacks the depth and intensity of Heat; ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This was a fun and exciting action movie. Unfortunately, Michael Mann's style is so distinctive that it's virtually impossible to avoid comparing the movie to Heat, which was clearly the better of the two. One of the film's best aspects is Mann's sweeping use of Los Angeles as his canvas, as it was in Heat. And the action is almost as good as the action in the earlier LA thriller. The acting was pretty good. Cruise, Foxx and Pinkett turned out decent performances, but how can they possibly compare to DeNiro, Pacino and Portman? The film's main weak point were the characters. They simply weren't as intense or as believable as those in Heat. Vincent was a pretty well-conceived character. Max wasn't. Max's sudden transformations from chilled-out playa to fretting bystander to steely stand-in for a hit man just didn't seem believable. That's the fault of the directors or writers, not of Foxx. In any one moment, he seemed more or less in character. But how in the world did he suddenly strap on the cochones during the sit-down with Felix? C'mon! Fanning really could've benefited from a lot more development. Since Max's heroism seemed to come out of nowhere, it would've been nice to see at least one hero-villain dynamic with some more complexity. For all of Fanning's pouting to his police partners, he didn't make any sort of headway with them. And for all his running around, he didn't do much to bring down Vincent. Mann should've either developed Fanning or left him out altogether. And then there were several small details that irked me. When did Max's sub sandwich suddenly disappear from the front seat so Vincent could sit down there without getting it all over the seat of his pants? And what the heck was going on when Vincent died? I mean... jeez, he's running all over the friggin' place with a bullet in the shoulder, and then he just sits down, utters some cliché and then dies? C'mon!"
143027,"Magic School, GREAT; OK, this has got to be one of the best movies this past 3 years. Johnny is absolutely excellent in his role as Danny. Johnny made me feel so much emotion , it was like I was living the experience with him instead of watching it. From his first dove trick to his putting the cursed ring on Max's finger.He brings to the screen the whole sense of wanting to belong, something everyone feels sometime or another. He makes it all seem so deal-able and manageable.Plus the movie is bringing magic and magicians back into life again,a trade that seemed like it was dying out, until this movie came out. It is sure to inspire magicians again and it certainly has inspired me.The movie has so much action and emotion. Plus the whole sense of magicians and an actual wizard. There are so much suspense and amazement so when the final scene is taking place it throws everything off. I'm beyond impressed with this movie and I've taped it so I can watch it for years to come."
32371,"a great must-see film, but not a ""film noir""; CALL NORTHSIDE 777 is a great film, but it is essentially a murder mystery, not a ""film noir."" The film noir cycle dates approximately from THE MALTESE FALCON (1941) to the TOUCH OF EVIL (1958). So CALL NORTHSIDE 777 was made during the noir period, but is not part of the noir cycle in my opinion (see my reasons below). Plot summary: Jimmy Stewart plays a reporter who investigates whether or not a washerwoman who offered a huge reward in the paper to prove her son's innocence is to pitied or believed. After some initial skepticism of her story he decides to track down witnesses to find out what really happened. ***************SPOILER BELOW****************** Eventually he finds her son to be innocent not via a witness but by using the printing technology of the time. The ending is quite effective so I will not spoil how he does it. ***************END OF SPOILER****************** Regarding my contention CALL NORTHSIDE 777 is not a film noir -- 1) Typically a film noir treats the problems of American society found by vets returning from WW2, or other negative aspects of society in the 1940's and 1950's. Usually both the protagonist and the villain in a noir have a dark side, or are far from the ideals society nominally strived to maintain at the time. However the mere fact that a film shows that are dark elements of society who do bad things is not sufficient to make it a ""noir."" Essential to the noir style is the allegorical subtext that the actors represent how society itself has gone wrong, not merely a playing out of their own private evil. Murder mysteries, thrillers, shock films, mad slasher films, etc all show dark private evils, but as a rule lack such an allegorical subtext. Hence such films as a rule are not noirs, but belong to one of the related genres that contain violence at a very private level. Stewart has no obvious dark side in this film other than his brief hesitation to take on the case. The governor of the state could also be faulted for his indifference to the outcome, but a modern post-Watergate viewer typically has a low opinion of gov. officials anyway. Stewart does travel into seedy neighborhoods in the course of his investigation, but the film does not imply that ""society"" is what caused the crime he is tracking down, or that the whole of Chicago is similarly seedy. 2) The film noirs made from 1940 to 1960 were usually shot in a very stylized type of black and white cinematography whose aim was to shot, disorient, or disgust the viewer. They were also usually shot on location -- the dirtier, the better. In many cases a strange disturbing musical score was used to heighten the effect that the film was not taking place on a typical Hollywood set. CALL NORTHSIDE 777 was shot on location in black and white, but uses neither jolting camera angles nor disturbing music. Many of the shots were of typical urban settings such a newspaper room. To conclude, CALL NORTHSIDE 777 is a must-see film due to Stewart's strong performance as a relentless seeker after Truth, and the many obstacles he has to overcome to find the truth in this particular case. However viewers expecting noir camera angles, spooky music, or psycho crooks should look elsewhere."
26546,hilariously funny; this is another great movie from the east. there is kung-fu there is horror there is great performances by a group of actors who are sometimes underrated. the movie is full of the typical humour expected from the jackie chan movies like the main character thinking the daughter of a millionaire is a hooker and when he questions her comes to believe she is sex mad and prostituting herself since her childhood and gets a slap! for his bother or even the policeman getting cutie branded on his chest during a fight with his uncle who became a vampire and tried to bite him. or a vampire who cant hop up the stairs or the even funnier resteraunt scene were never having had an western breakfast two men pouring milk and sugar onto their custard tarts. but watch it for yourself a i guarantee you'll love it. just do yourself a favour watch the Cantonese language version watching oriental movies dubbed just lacks something trust me you'll get used to subtitles and the language.
2389,"incredibly dumb; *** possible small spoilers *** to put it frankly: this might just be the dumbest movie i have ever seen. only recently did i see the original version of 'psycho' (hitchcock, 1960) for the first time and even though it wasn't nowhere near the perfection of, say, the masterpiece that is 'vertigo' (1958) it was a great movie - excellent hitchcock'ish work with the script giving the viewer small hints all through the movie, having us believe the story is about something that just turns out not to be of any importance at all, great camera work, magnificent acting and a haunting musical score summed up to a very memorable movie. there is little doubt why it became a classic and is regarded one of milestones in American cinema. and then there's this remake by gus vant sant from 1998 that just remains a mystery to me. all through the movie i sat and tried to figure out if it was a homage to his childhood idol or if it was a bad parody - based on the EXACT same plot with the actors making (or: trying to) the EXACT same facial expressions and saying the EXACT same words it remains unclear why this movie was made at all. it brings absolutely nothing new to the film at all, it is just an extremely bad remake; the actors are merely distorted images of the original performances - exactly the same, just worse. the camera work is nice, but boring compared to hitchcock's (that was filmed 38 years earlier!) and the subtle horror and special feel surrounding the 1960 version just seem to have disappeared completely. but hey! it is in color! oh, oh no, that doesn't work as well as the black and white play with shadows and lighting either. bottom line: watch the great original version of 'psycho' or don't watch it at all. 1/10"
3697,"Not hte greatest, but not a bad as everyone goes on about.; ** Might Contain some spoilers** First of all, this movie isn't worse than Predator 1. It's definitely a flaw when the movie tries to repeat the same ''what is it?'' suspense. But there are still good parts to P2. I'm not so sure about the little pressie Danny receives at the end, but I wouldn't give it something like, 4/10. I still enjoyed Predator 2 despite the flaws in it. (Oh, and by the way, the Predator DOSEN'T see the light through the normal thermal vision, too everybody who says that). I think all of us know there's been a lot worse crap B-movies horror movies made. Although it dosn't compare to other horror movies either, Pred 2 is just above average."
7201,"A lot of fun; An American having lived in France for more than 10 years, I enjoyed the movie for a number of reasons: recognizing the actors from many other films,living almost daily with the comparisons between French and American, knowing Chicago and identifying with the characters reactions on being in the US for the first time. Most of all, though, was the film's excellent script (no loose ends), great interpretation by the actors, and the unique combination of seriousness (violence and loss of life) with the comedy of the situation and this all wrapped up with a fun and unusual ending. I watched the film 3 times in the French version and look forward to seeing it again in English, which I hope will be as good."
144936,"Reprehensible in so may ways; Why do I hate this film? Here we go. 1. It's supposed to be a comedy, but it raises a faint smile a maximum of THREE times. All other attempts at humour are failures, and really obvious failures. 2. It features Russell Dykstra, who was fantastic in Soft Fruit. Even in this crap, you can see that he's talented, but who is ever going to take him on after he's been tainted by this excrement? 3. It's sexist. 4. It's racist. 5. It's homophobic. 6. It relies on a ""cute"" kid, who delivers his lines with all the plausibility of a hatstand, and for some reason calls undies ""jocks,"" though he's supposed to be Australian. 7. It sets out to satirise the Wiggles, but is so feeble that any Wiggles video would outdo it easily in the wit stakes. 8. It has a cameo by Bert Newton. 9. It has a cameo by Rove McManus. 10. Rove McManus! And there was no warning on the cover, or before the film."
79925,"Prince of Swashbucklers!; I first saw PRINCE OF FOXES on The Fabulous 52, a movie TV premier series, on KNXT-TV back in the 1950s. The film made such an impact on me I later searched for the source book, Samuel Shellabarger's novel, and read it and his other historical adventures. The movie is better than the book. Power, Welles and in particular Everett Sloane excel; only Wanda Hendrix disappoints. She is by far too shallow and light for the role of the Lady Dona Camilla. Filmed where it would have happened, with money trapped in Italy after the war by Italian monetary policy that wouldn't allow Fox movie profits to leave the country (there was enough money for the movie, but not for color, alas), PRINCE is evocative of a real place and a real time. Sloane's betrayal of Power, and reversal, is one of the best moments in film. When Sloane plucks out Power's eyes with his thumbs  ""Scream! Scream, I tell you!""  it's one of the great moments in adventure film. And later, when Belli (Sloane), who posed for painter Power as Judas, laughs at his revolving duplicity, you can't help but laugh with him. If PRINCE OF FOXES has weakness (excepting those already mentioned, the absence of color and the leading lady's absence of presence), it's that there isn't enough of it. The film is too quick, the afterimage too fleeting from the eye. I'm always left wanting to see more. PRINCE OF FOXES is the best swashbuckler I've ever seen. It should be available on DVD for everyone to enjoy."
8529,"Two Sides, job oriented - human oriented.; Good movie and good directing. Everything happens in an airport but you don't feel the disturbing closed, crowded, annoying side of it (Unless Spielberg wants you to). Tom Hanks looks like he doesn't act. He is like a guy from Krakozhia. The movie doesn't use the cheap way by making fun about the different culture (Like a lot of movies these days use the ignorance with a cheap fashion of fun making). Every movie has to have a bit of love in it so because of that they added the Zeta Jones's character which meant nothing because the character was not portrayed deep enough. Severe criticism goes to the immigration system. It is understandable. On one side you see an honest guy waiting on the other side you see the terrorists walking.... Fun to watch with the family."
27611,"Lightyears ahead of the original---superior and groundbreaking television!; Nothing against the creator of this show, Glen A. Larson, but the original looks like a rehearsal compared to this awesome remake. Everything about this show---the color schemes used in the direction, the subtle drum beats used in the battle sequences, the beautiful Bernard Herrman -- like melodies used in the music score works like a cinematic event. In the premiere episode, the sequence of the Cylon attack on the civilian ships who couldn't make the jump to light speed (the one with the little girl sitting alone) was underscored with chimes and soft drums for music. This scene absolutely sent chills down my spine...even better than the crashing musical scores used in ""Star Wars"" battle sequences!! What a fantastic show...I give it 11 stars out of 10!"
6629,"Hollywood's first major 3-D feature is a knock-out - but ONLY in 3-D...; HOUSE OF WAX Aspect ratio: 1.37:1 (Natural Vision 3-Dimension) Sound format: WarnerPhonic Sound Though BWANA DEVIL (1952) was clearly responsible for kickstarting the 3-D boom of the 1950's, it's doubtful the fad would have survived for long had it not been for Andre de Toth's HOUSE OF WAX, ballyhooed by Warner Bros. as: ""The BIG 3-D feature you've been waiting for!"" The studio's confidence is borne out by the film itself, a sensational - and sensationalized - remake of Michael Curtiz's MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM (1933), in which sculptor and wax museum curator Vincent Price is driven insane after being disfigured in a fire set by his greedy business partner (Roy Roberts), eager to reap the benefits of a generous insurance policy. Using a wax mask to conceal his true appearance, Price makes short work of Roberts and reopens his museum in New York, where he steals fresh cadavers and uses them as the human framework for his gruesome exhibits, only to be rumbled by heroine Phyllis Kirk when her recently-murdered friend (Carolyn Jones) turns up as part of the Joan of Arc exhibit... With its handsome period art direction - the movie is set in 1902 - and no-nonsense screenplay, this was clearly designed as one of Warner's major attractions for 1953, above and beyond the film's technical achievements. Today, the storyline may seem a little predictable, even for those unfamiliar with Curtiz's original, but the narrative unfolds at a rapid clip and contains more than a few hair-raising set-pieces, most notably the opening fire sequence (in which Price looms uncomfortably close to the raging inferno); the discovery of Roberts' corpse in an elevator shaft; Price's cloaked villain stealing a corpse from the morgue at midnight and pursuing Kirk through the fog-shrouded streets; and the climactic face-off around a vat of boiling wax. There's even a chorus of dancing girls (watch out for those legs!), along with a couple of ferocious fight scenes which - literally! - erupt from the screen! Price achieved lasting fame as a consequence of the film's box office success - he was quickly snared by Columbia for their own 3-D horror feature, THE MAD MAGICIAN (1954), sealing his fate as one of Hollywood's premier boogeymen - but except for the scenes in which he appears as a malformed ghoul, his performance is too restrained to be entirely effective, and the same could be said of virtually all the principal players. Only Jones (later TV's Morticia Addams) as Kirk's giggling, gold-digging best friend and Paul Cavanagh (THE FOUR SKULLS OF JONATHAN DRAKE) as the unwitting patron of Price's latest venture make much of an impression, while Frank Lovejoy and Dabbs Greer are the hard-working cops whose suspicions lead to the villain's downfall. However, while the characters may be bland and unremarkable, the film succeeds by virtue of its spectacle, and recent festival screenings (to celebrate 50 years since the first 3-D boom) have been sold out on every occasion, reaffirming its enduring appeal as one of the finest movies of its kind. Reviewers often claim the film is 'just as good' when screened flat, and while there's no denying the production's many virtues, the 3-D version is a REVELATION! Using the dual-camera Natural Vision format developed by Milton and Julian Gunzberg (first used in BWANA DEVIL the year before), cinematographers Bert Glennon and J. Peverell Marley use the process to emphasize depth in every sequence, framing each shot to highlight the angles in Stanley Fleischer's careful set designs. For commercial reasons, de Toth includes a number of crowd-pleasing off-the-screen effects (Reggie Rymal's infamous paddle-ball is the most fondly-remembered), though the film doesn't overplay it's hand in this respect. Contemporary audiences were startled out of their seats during a climactic sequence in which Bronson looms out of the FOREGROUND to attack hero Paul Picerni, one of several passages created specifically with 3-D in mind, and which are rendered completely ineffective and/or pointless in flat versions. Viewing the film minus its dimensional effects is like watching a pan-scan edition of a widescreen movie, in which half the entertainment value has been cruelly revoked. Warner Bros. also used ""House"" to inaugurate their short-lived WarnerPhonic Sound system, which added an even greater dimension to proceedings. Multichannel sound wasn't a new concept at the time (Disney had used the Fantasound process as early as 1940 for FANTASIA, for instance), but it WAS decidedly rare in mass market features (THIS IS CINERAMA introduced a 7-track process in 1952, but Cinerama was a non-starter for regular movie houses). And while most theaters played the movie in standard optical mono, lucky patrons who attended engagements in major metropolitan areas enjoyed ""The first phenomenal merger of 3-D action! 3-D color! and 3-D sound!"", as per the ads. Sadly, the WarnerPhonic tracks have since been lost, and current multichannel versions feature a remix of the mono elements by Chace Stereo, no more than a fair approximation of the original material."
171429,"Pure comedy; Without tracing for the subject of the movie one could watch it just for laughing. In fact it is a story of a man who is forced to act like someone else who has great influence (a magnate&general,kemal sunal as tosun pasa) on behalf of a large family which is one of the two families struggling to grab the possession of a very fertile and rich piece of land, namely yesil vadi(green valley). Besides the leader of the family, Lutfu, takes advantage of fake tosun pasa to get married himself with the daughter of the mayor of the region. The family who has made the fake tosun pasa uses him until the real tosun pasa comes.As he arrives, the real tosun pasa, he starts to act as someone else in order to find who benefits from this situation. After he realizes the situation he starts action and first removes both families from the yesil vadi and marries himself with the daughter of the mayor. This situation is similar to the situation where two people is fighting, another one comes up and beats them both and then leaves. Believe me, even without getting the story you will laugh until cramps start at your cheeks. Vote: 10/10"
147182,"Words cannot say how bad this is.; This movie is crap. How else can I put it? Its... beyond bad? This movie is the ultimate badness. It has all the elements of a sub-B-grade movie. Firstly, forget the sci part of sci-fi. There is not even a pretense of real science in here. To be fair, there is also no attempt to call it science. Its a cheap monster-flick, and makes no effort to be anything else. Now, this can only be appreciated as a comedy. It is that bad. From the rather strange monster to the annoying computer-voice to the blocky white-painter architecture of the lab, its the representation of its genre: Those films that are so bad you have to laugh. Funniest moment... Alien Thing gets shot with the full output of a building-sized particle accelerator. Huge blue glow, sparks, and out steps a perfectly normal, unburnt human."
8919,"P.S. is B.S.; ""P.S."" is a film stuck in a time warp -- and it doesn't even seem to be the right decade. Louise Harrington (Laura Linney) has never recovered emotionally from the accidental death of her high-school boyfriend. Assuming that the action of the film is in the present day, the tragedy should have taken place in 1982. Yet, in many ways, the look and feel of ""P.S."" is reminiscent of the 1960s or 70s. For instance, Louise's office at Columbia University has a klunky, awkward-looking push-button phone, where we would expect a more streamlined model. There are tensor lamps in both her office and her apartment. In the early scenes, Louise is outfitted in knee-high boots, a shawl, and a cross between a beret and a knitted cap. The boots look like something Emma Peel would wear, and as for the headgear -- I'm thinking Mary Tyler Moore tossing her hat in the air, Ali McGraw in ""Love Story"", and Olivia Hussey in ""Romeo and Juliet"". The business etiquette and sexual politics are all wrong, too. When F. Scott Feinstadt (Topher Grace) applies for admission to Columbia, he sends a handwritten letter that should rightly end up in the reject pile. When Louise calls to set up an interview, he addresses her by her first name -- another social faux pas. She's not much better. She meets with him in her office behind closed doors, clad in a low-cut affair that's a combination of peasant blouse and Daisy Yokum. Hello? Isn't she concerned about possible impropriety, so say nothing of sexual harassment charges? It seems like the only concession to 21st-century sexual etiquette is the use of a condom during sex. These glaring flaws put me off completely and made it difficult to swallow the central conceit of the film, which is cockamamie enough in itself: that F. Scott is Louise's boyfriend, somehow returned from the dead. I suppose the idea is that almost-forty Louise gets a second chance and a new lease on life, yada, yada. Meanwhile, there's this girlfriend rivalry thing going on between Louise and Missy (Marcia Gay Harden) that's right out of ""The Turning Point"". Gabriel Byrne is fine as Louise's ex-husband, dealing with a lifelong addiction to sex (except with his wife, apparently). But Topher Grace simply appears to be going through the motions. To be fair, there is one scene in ""P.S."" that is brilliantly written and seamlessly performed by Laura Linney. If Linney were nominated as best actress for ""P.S."", this is the clip that would roll on Oscar night, and the film is worth seeing if only for this scene. With a young, callow Topher Grace looking at himself in the mirror, she paints a dismal, depressing picture of the indignities that middle age will some day visit upon him. The bitterness and despair and harshness in her voice strike exactly the right note. Trust me, I know. I'm touching fifty myself."
8985,"Oh dear; We're fans of the last 2 and I'd really been looking forward to this film. Cheaply made. Did they run out of money on this one or did the main actor(s) command most of the budget? Mainly shot in offices, on rooftops. A couple of exploding cars. Maybe glaziers charge a lot for glass, plenty of that shattered. Few vampire extras to speak of. One or two makeup/cgi effects and an interesting weapon or two. Action As usual with a series, the first one has a decent story, the remainder start with lots of explosions, action and the hero appears amongst the havoc within the first few minutes. Fast action continues through to the end. OK if you don't have any brain cells. storyline Dracula raised. Vampire killers need his blood to energise a virus. Virus to be let loose on world to kill all vampires. Vampire killers go and do that. OK. Character interaction Was there any? Even the fights were small discrete pieces of action. No character development and little interaction. You just don't get to care about any of them (except whatsisname who has a lovely 6 pack, cor!) Baddies Dracula of course. Skinny vampire woman with bad teeth, attitude but not much personality. Nothing going for her aside from that. Children/animals It's a series so a cute spunky kid is brought in somewhere in episode 2 or 3. Indy did it, chainsaw massacre 3, the mummy, Aliens etc The little pooch was cute too. Dallas Similarities between Bobby Ewing and whatsisface's illegitimate daughter arriving on the scene. You got to be kidding Police station surrounded by angry screeching police cars. As the heros leave the building they get shot at, then quietness while an escape vehicle pulls up next to the heros (in front of police). Guy gets out and tells them to get in the car. They jump in and drive away and get shot at again. No one seems bothered during the escape itself and none of the police cars follow the getaway vehicle. Heros walking down street in weird leather gear with swords, archery equipment etc and no-one bats an eye. er, well it is the USA I suppose. Dracula Did they have to choose him? Surely the development of vampire lore in recent years (in pc gaming especially) could have given a better antihero. I could have forgiven that if they hadn't picked a chunky non charismatic bouncer with a no. 2 shaven head? Would have preferred a more James Bond type for this role Humour Personally, I didn't notice any except for Blade with the baby (and the dog) Usually the bad guys main bruiser (you know, there's always a thicky chunk that gets several unlucky amputations and recovers) gets some funny scenes but these were few and far between here Music The first 2 had very catchy funky hypnotic club music. I can't even recall the music style from this one but not impressed when I watched it. In all a very shallow, disjointed, cheap, unsexy action follow on. Maybe needed an extra hour to introduce some depth."
133259,"yasmin; Yasmin is about the effects of a British Muslim before and after the 9/11 period. It stars Archie panjabi who stars as Yasmin, a Muslim woman to find herself. she leads a double life at home she act as a traditional Muslim girl and at work she tries to blend in with work colleges. She also has an arrange marriage with a cousin so he can visa in the country. The first half is quite light hearted drama, but the tone of film starts to change after the 9/11 twin towers attack. She finds herself getting racial abuse from work mates, abuse from public and then her husband is falsely accused of being a terrorist. When she visit her husband to get a divorce she also finds herself being accused of having terrorist connections. From this point she starts to re-evaluate her life and her Muslim beliefs. As being a Muslim myself i found this to be the first drama that actually gave an accurate portrayal of what Brit-Muslim went though and how they felt. Archie panjabi fantastic performance and a realistic portrayal of a Muslim. I would recommend seeing this if you want to see how Muslims really felt.I have recently seen a lot of dramas about Muslim during the 9/11 period and have not been happy with how Muslims are constantly being made out to be terrorist,so i was surprised to see a realistic drama that showed Muslim in a good light. Also this drama is based on true facts as the film makers did research in the Muslim community and asked Muslims about how they were treated during that time. Over all i thought this was a good and realist drama and world recommend it to anyone who wants to see a realistic portrayal of British Muslims."
57873,"Dolph's best solo project! Pure, fun 80's style action!!; As an action lover firstly, Dark Angel is a film that any enthusiast will find hard not to enjoy. It's a great, and entertaining slice of violent sci-fi hokum served up in a brisk 89 minutes. Secondly as a fans of Dolph Lundgren, it marks perhaps his most polished and entertaining solo work. The 80's itself was a great time for action movies, with countless action stars, and the essential ingredients were a simple plot, plenty of wise cracking and plenty of action. Lundgren had been responsible for the far more stern and serious action flicks Red Scorpion and the under-rated Punisher film yet Dark Angel was one of a string of 3 films Dolph did, very much in the trend of Schwarzenegger's simpler action films like Red Heat, Running Man and Raw Deal. It was brainless, yet highly enjoyable, slick and violent. Dolph followed this entertaining fare with the similarly comic book styled Showdown In Little Tokyo and then Universal Soldier. These three films remain Dolph's apex. He got the humour right in them and they are best described as Arnie styled actioners. Dark Angel though had a twist on the concept with the slightly imaginative idea of an Alien coming down from outer space, injecting victims full of heroin and then using hi-tech alien techniques, removing the endorphins from the brain. It's implausible but who cares? Naturally Dolph has to save the day and has help from uptight FBI pen pusher Brian Benben. What marks this film as Dolphs career highlight is the fact that this is his movie, 100%. Dolph is the star, the head honcho. His other best films had him share the screen with bigger, or soon to be bigger stars like Stallone, Van Damme and Brandon Lee. The chemistry between Lundgren and Benben works superbly, and Lundgren is on fine Arnie zinger form. It makes you wonder why some of the one liners in his other films don't come off when he delivered them so perfectly in this film. In some respects this is a Dolph out of Dolph movie, with him sporting dark brown hair and brown contacts. Directed by Craig R Baxley, the stunt co-ordinator and sometimes director for the A- Team, the action of this piece has a slick polish to it and there is plenty of it too. In fact this film probably features the largest number of exploding cars ever. The concept of the Alien brings in some imaginary and cool weaponry including a super hand gun, and deadly flying CD's that lock into the electric current in the human body, as Dolph's scientist friend (a bit of luck in Dolphy's little black book) explains ""It's like setting your radio dial to K-I-L-L!"" The script is blessed with some witty one-liners that would make the Governator proud. Dolph is good in the lead doing the macho thing well and kicking ass in the action. Then there is good support from Benben and Betsy Brantley. This film surprisingly flopped in the states and you have to wonder why. It still remains Dolph's biggest critical hit, especially in Europe where it was received mostly positively. It's a solid middle of the road 3 star film, you can't give it more because of its simplicity yet even those not massively keen on action films would find it hard not to enjoy. It's a guilty pleasure movie like Commando, like Last Boy Scout and the like. The movie did good business in the UK and particularly on video. As a youngster this was one of my favourite action movies. The whole cool factor you get from the Alien and his weapons, combined with the 80's action machismo sensibility. Overall this is a piece of simple entertainment. To be enjoyed for it's guilty taste, that slips down the throat guilty, like chocolate, this is not recommended for its nutritional value. ***"
8973,"Bad movie...; I had such a terrible experience watching Bad Education. I almost left the movie theater, disgusted not only for the soft gay porno images but for the confusing story shown by Almodovar, in my opinion the most overrated filmmaker. Gael Garcia Bernal is worthy to see. I enjoyed his performance at Motorcycle Diaries. The rest of the for me unknown actors were overacting all the times. The background music was awful. A dark, depressing story about even more depressing people, narrated in a confusing way (actors using different names) made this movie certainly the worst I've ever seen and certainly will be the last Almodovar work I am going to see."
6768,"Luther rebels!; I am a Lutheran. That is a big reason why I wanted to see this movie. Surprisingly, my dad, who is an atheist, wanted to see this movie to. I really liked it. If I could, I'd give it a nine-point-five out of ten. It truly is the best of '03. Great acting by everyone. A wonderful plot. One thing, though, it is a little graphic for small children, i.e. a room full of dead people, a dead man with his arm cut off, a man with a wooden stake through his body. It brilliantly shows shows how Luther separates from the Catholic Church. It shows the Catholic church trying to kill Luther once he is excommunicated. It really shows a big difference between Lutherans and Catholics. Near the end of the movie, Martin Luther gets married. Of course the Catholic Church is outraged with this. In the end, Martin Luther receives news. You'll just have to watch the movie for yourself. My vote: 9.5 out of 10"
2455,"Gross! But it inspired a classic pun!; I saw this movie once. Never again. David Cronenberg seems to be going out of his way in this movie to gross out the audience. The problem is, he mistakes revulsion for genuine horror and suspense. This movie has one redeeming value. It inspired what has to be the All-Time Classic Worst Pun in the History of the World. It came from Bob Hope: ""Hey, did you see this new movie, ""The Fly?"" Jeff Goldblum plays a mad scientist who accidentally turns himself into a giant fly. My favorite scene in the movie is when the scientist and his wife are sitting in a restaurant. The scientist drinks a bowl of soup, and his wife turns to the waiter and says, 'Waiter, there's a soup in my fly!'"""

8983,"Maddeningly disappointing; Okay, it's actually a pretty good film, but after being so absolutely blown away by Zhang's previous martial arts picture, Hero, his follow up could only disappoint. It just feels so unambitious and small in comparison. The script is far less interesting and timeless. It takes over half the movie before anything especially fascinating happens. Sure, the ""echo game"" scene is okay. But think of Hero, whose first set piece was the fight between Nameless and Sky. When I saw that back in August, my jaw hit the floor. I knew I was in for something truly amazing. The echo game is interesting, but also a bit silly. I guess a lot of things in Hero were silly, too, when you think about them  like the lake fight between Nameless and Broken Sword. But Hero captivated me, where Daggers barely registered. As far as the martial arts sequences go, I wasn't astounded by a single one. The bamboo forest was the best, but it isn't as wonderful as, say, the fight in the trees from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or, indeed, even the bamboo forest fights of King Hu's A Touch of Zen, a picture I didn't like at all. It's only in Flying Dagger's final sequence where it triumphs over the mediocrity that has been trying to creep in throughout the film. Even with it, it still feels like only three-quarters of a movie. I'm probably being more harsh than I ought to, though. It has many worthwhile elements. The costumes are particularly great, and the only aspect that I would say is beyond Hero is the music. 7/10."
26137,"If you want the real story on this major achievement of the allies - AVOID this film!; This film has almost nothing in common with the real events of the Commandos that did the sabotage at Rjukan. It is just a cheap Hollywood movie that tries to get credibility by stating - based on a true story. Like so many other WW2 movies from Hollywood. This also skews the truth so much, it is not even close to what the heroes experienced back then. As a movie however, it might be watchable. If you want the real story, you might want to look for the BBC documentary about the subject. A well done documentary that tries to recreate the conditions and experience some of the hardship themselves. They don't come close to what the actual heroes did, but the effect of what they do do is pretty amazing in itself. And it just makes the actual event even more incredible!"
30812,"Interesting, but not gripping; When I saw this film, I didn't know what it was going to be about, but with DiCaprio and a title such as ""The Aviator"" I thought it was going to be a good action film. Unfortunately this was not the case. The film was the based on the life of the famous director and aviator Howard Hughes. What resulted was an interesting look on the Howard Hughes, life. Hughes himself was brilliantly played by DiCaprio who managed to maintain my interest in the film. Kate Beckinsale also looked amazing in the film adding a bit of colour to it. There were a few moments of comedy and the scenes involving the planes were very dramatic. What let this film down though was its length. I myself had not studied Howard Hughes' life but managed to predict a quite boring ending to what was a very long film. Therefore I lost my interest in it near the end and was happy to get out of the cinema after a quite boring ending. In conclusion, the film is a very interesting look on Hughes' life, but it's not going to keep your attention if you're after an action film."
4308,"9/10; I am not a fan of musicals. I often avoid to see them at cinema, but sometimes I see them on DVD and regret my choice. There are many musicals that can be considered the best movies ever: The Blues Brothers, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Rocky Horror Picture Show to name a few. This is a beautiful musical, too, that can compete for quality with the above mentioned ones, even if I voted 9 for this (my favorite ones are perfection). First the music is great. It has so many famous songs rewritten to fit in the script. I was delighted especially by the ""Like a virgin"" scene and by ""Show must go on"" (I'm always touched when I hear this magnificent song. It tells a lot of life and death and can be considered the most impressive testament by Freddy Mercury. One of my favorite songs ever). The initial song (I knew a boy..) is also very touching. So, the music is great, the script is funny and well written, the direction is wonderful, the actors are great, Nicole is sexy and as good as usual. But Jim Broadbent (the owner of mouline rouge) is the best actor in the play. He creates a character that you cannot easily forget. Don't miss this movie in DVD. 9 out of 10."
30812,"Really Great Movie, but needs an intermission; I found this movie, extremely enjoyable. It was exciting and very realistic. The movie did a great job of showing how much Howard had to fight to maintain control over all the projects he had going on, in spite of his mental illness. But when the chips were down, he always seemed to pull himself together to get the job done. The scenes of his testimony before Congress were especially well done. I also very much enjoyed the interaction between Howard and some of the women in his life, like Kathern Hepburn. This movie is good viewing for any history buff, who would find the life and times of Howard Hughs interesting. Only thing, a movie this long, needs an intermission for us older folks. Just a few minutes would have been fine."
457,"One of the best thrillers, the chase is suspenseful throughout; The fugitive, in a nutshell is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. The pace never lets up, and the best touch is that the director uses brain action to drive the plot instead of violent action, which lets us identify with the characters. And what brilliantly constructed characters! First there's Dr. Richard Kimble(well played by Harrison ford), falsely accused of murdering his wife and on the run after a brutal bus wreck. We start to identify with him as well as root for him as he searches for his wife's killer. And then there's United States Marshall Sam Gerard(in Tommy Lee Jone's academy award winning role) who attempts to hunts Kimble down. The interesting thing about Gerard is that we begin to root for him too, seeing his tough,relentless character at work.There are moments in this film when Jone's is so unbelievable you heart skips a beat,yet Ford nor Jones take the spotlight. The lead is shared. In the few scenes they have together the interplay is near perfect. The murder and the conviction take place very quickly at the beginning allowing for the rest of the story to evolve over a longer time.This is well done, though it leaves us wondering why Kimble was sentenced to death on such circumstantial evidence. Hats off to the support cast! Joe pantoliano and Julianne Moore both turn in excellent performances. The one problem I have with this film is that the Dam scene is overrated. The previous scene in the tunnel was exceptional yet the stunt in question happened too fast and is undeserving of it's fame. The best scene in the film is when Kimble struggles to get through the electronic door at the prison as Gerard thunders after him. In say, James Bond films you hold your breath while the hero is in danger and let it go when he escapes. In this film you hold your breath for the full two hours until the final shot when you'll let it go. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys films and if you haven't already seen it go to the video store and rent a copy of this definitive classic."
30816,"Are paid critics the right people to criticise?; I sometimes wonder where film critics learn their trade. I believe that, if we are invited to read the opinions of someone who gets paid for giving them, then the very least we should expect is a reasoned, objective augment of the subject. It seems to me that many professional critics use their voice, not to make considered appraisals of the movie they have seen, but to give us all an exhibition of how well they can employ irony (often bordering sarcasm) in their writing. All too frequently however, they misjudge their audience. Rather than applaud their wit, we tend rather to lament their ignorance. Some critics of The Phantom of The Opera may serve as an illustration. One even went so far as to criticize the story. Gaston Leroux may not have been the most noteworthy of French writers but, as a rather excellent biography on this website will attest, he excelled at the genre of Gothic Romance. That's what Phantom is and we mustn't lose sight of that fact. One critic speaks slightingly of the gaslamp effects conjoured in the film. ""So what?"" he asks, suggesting that modern audiences expect  and usually get  so much more. If we go to the cinema to watch Gothic Romance then we must expect to watch something like Phantom or Frankenstein or Wuthering Heights. It is fatuous to criticise the story! And this movie is Gothic Romance par excellence. All the ingredients are there in abundance. The subterranean chambers, the gas lamps, the masques, damsels in distress and of course that hint of the supernatural. All enhanced by the music of that awfully repetitive and predictably tedious composer whose work is still being listened to on Broadway after eighteen years! Oh when will people wake up to the fact they are being asked to enjoy such kitsch  as some critic from Chicago described the film? Something I have found critics singularly incapable of doing is suspending their disbelief. This impediment ensures that they also suspend their enjoyment. One dreads to think how some of them would approach Macbeth. Probably criticise the story."
276,"Entertaining feel-good comedy; Very conservative people might not like the plot of this film (kid tries to get his widowed dad and an ex-hooker to fall in love with each other), but actually everything is quite harmless and fun. The story gets sometimes a bit silly (especially when the boy takes Melanie Griffith to school as part of his ""science project""), but the acting and the comedy is good. There was always a smile on my lips as I watched the misunderstandings between Harris and Griffith, when the dad believes that she is a math tutor and the hooker believes he knows her true job. Ed Harris does a good job as the shy father, and Melanie Griffith is believable as the golden hearted hooker. But it's the kid (Michael Patrick Carter) the one who steals the show, with his winning smile and his mixture of innocence and curiosity."
1034,"Fascinating celluloid stew of sleaze; A brilliant, deliciously creative title sequence, backed by a manic Danny Elfman score, sets the trashy, perverted tone of this ""adult"" version of ""Little Red Riding Hood"". After her parents (Amanda Plummer and Michael T. Weiss) are arrested for prostitution and a parole violation, Vanessa (Reese Witherspoon) hits the road for Granny's house. Along the way she meets rapist/kiddie porn-loving psychologist Bob Wolverton (Keifer Sutherland) and pumps some bullets into him for his inevitable transgression. The narrative here is deliberately nuts and the perverted tone is not to be taken seriously. Trash-loving director Mathew Bright, who also helmed the gloriously exploitive BUNDY, blends elements from slasher movies, courtroom dramas, women-in-prison (WIP) epics, horror flicks and soft core porn flicks into this fascinating celluloid stew. Bright, like Larry Clark, appears to be cinematic ally obsessed with women's crotches and panties and sexually promiscuous girls of the under aged or barely legal variety (this is not a criticism, merely an observation). In one zipper-busting scene, a semi-crippled hottie stands up into frame to give us a front seat view of her crotch. During a fight amongst prison inmates, dresses are ripped asunder and, as expected, lesbian love finds a home in Vanessa's jail cell. The festering air of sleaze and shameless exploitation makes FREEWAY a refreshing little number. You can only admire Bright's affectionate approach to the trashy material and be grateful that the once-great John Waters did not get a crack at it. The resolution at Granny's house is too predictable to carry any weight, but the trip itself is never boring. Witherspoon is a ball of angry talent in her first major starring role and has done nothing this interesting since."
8783,"The village, a major disappointment.; After watching the trailer and read the reviews I got the idea that The village was supposed to be this spooky horror movie. Unlike this bimbo run around screaming movies, since I kinda liked Signs and it was the director of signs and everything. Although in the beginning of the film you really get spooked and you start to question yourself, what is in those woods? And you yourself get to use your own imagination which makes it scary. And at that point thats were you get excited and wanna continue watching the movie. But after a while the movie kinda tend to become somewhat more like a drama with personal conflicts and tragedy. So that kinda wears off all the excitement and horror. So if your looking for a spooky horror movie to see I woulden't recommend you to watch The village. But are you you after a surprising movie with an unpredictable twist this is most surly your movie."
2858,"""so much beauty in the world...."".; This movie is almost a flag of all middle class families of the world.It is a discussion about what is insane and what makes sense, who is popular and who is ""superficial"", why are we living for and how stupid we are if we deny to do things we want to do. Kevin spacey is terrific in his role as Lester and the scene when he is ""fired"" is memorable. The sense of humor continuous with a mix of tragedy with Captain Fits and his weird family. Let's live our stupid little life!!! And buy a Thunderbird!In my opinion, this was the best movie in the last 5 years for it's cast, direction and history.""Look closer""....you will see a master piece!"
6291,"Heartbreak, despair,  anger and tears.; This is a terrible movie. It's terrible because it should not be necessary for movies like this to be made. But in the real world these situations do happen and far too easily. Lukas Moodysson has made a magnificent and at the same time utterly heartbreaking movie. Oksana Akinshina and Artyom Bogucharsky both deserve awards for their roles in this film. Both give performances that put to shame about 99% of any mainstream actor you care to mention. I have to admit that I was reduced to tears by both of them. And then I felt angry followed by a sense of despair at their fate. Oksana Akinshina should have a great career ahead of her if she gets offered the right roles. So far, all she has had is a part in The Bourne Supremacy. Maybe Hollywood is a little reluctant to upset their star system by using a Russian who can actually act as well as being attractive. Lilya 4 ever is not easy to watch but once you are watching, it's impossible to look away. Trafficking in children and child prostitution is a serious problem that needs to be addressed by all governments, but sadly, very few are interested in doing anything about it. Maybe if this movie got the publicity it deserves, something might happen. But don't hold your breath. Just watch this movie and cry for these victims of their circumstances and an evil trade. With the votes cast for Lilya 4 Ever it should be in the top 250, why is it being kept out?"
353,"Life imitating film?; This was an absolutely captivateing film for me to watch, it filled me with every emotion you could possible think, Hatred for the bad guys, Triumph for the good guys but mostly sadness for the loss not only in the film but for Brandon Lee who obviously never got to see what an amazing actor he really was, It was as if life was imitating film and its just terribly ironic that an engaged, much in love couple get killed in the film and Brandon himself was only two weeks from his own marriage and that he died on the exact set in which his character (Eric Draven) did. After watching this film i just felt i wanted to learn more about the film and the circumstances which surrounded the filming it. I obtained the ""Making of the Crow"" book and read it from cover to cover that to captivated me and it is well worth a read for all those that enjoyed the film. We may never no the true circumstances in which Brandon was killed but i do know that he was aa special actor with an emotion and a passion for what he did you could tell that from the emotional portrayal of love and loss in the crow."
7024,"One of the most gruelling films ever made; Pier Paolo Pasolini, as is well known, was murdered not long after he finished work on this, his most audacious and confrontational film, yet even the most casual viewing of SALO begs the question - had he not been murdered, would he have taken his own life anyway? Every sequence, every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair, barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race, one gets the impression that Pasolini was barely hanging onto life - and any attendant shreds of hope - by his fingernails. Although ostensibly an adaptation of one of DeSade's most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the Second World War with the Fascist ruling classes as its (authentically vile) villains, SALO also contains a lot of contemporary criticism - Pasolini hated the modern world, and explained the stomach-churning 'banquet of s**t' as a none-too-subtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains. (The scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society - those who come to SALO expecting titillation or B-movie sleaze will be sorely disappointed.) Beyond the nihilistic content, which has been well documented elsewhere, the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washed-out, faded film stock using primarily static cameras, long shots, choppy editing and very few cutaways, SALO has a visual style reminiscent of cinema-verite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music, piano dirges and the (intentionally?) scrappy post-dubbed dialogue, and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. SALO comes across as one long primal scream of rage, designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency, and in this respect, the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once, or indeed for 'entertainment', is another matter, but SALO is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it."
8366,"Interesting in many ways; After watching 'Saved', a rather unfamiliar satire of Christianity crossed with a high-school comedy/drama, I found myself rather puzzled of the intentions of the makers and the meaning of this movie. When reading some of the external reviews presented, I found both the point of Rogert Ebert as well as James Berardinelli interesting, meaningful, and true in it's own merit. While Berardinelli is slamming this movie as anti-Christian, claiming 'Saved! treats religion as a disease, not a life choice', the (often overly positive) Ebert concludes that 'by the end of the movie, mainstream Christian values have not been overthrown, but demonstrated and embraced'. Two completely different views on this movie, but after watching it I felt both claims to be somewhat true. Let's start with the beginning. Christian teen Mary (Jena Malone) is confronted by her boyfriend that he's gay. She thinks she can 'cure' him by having sex with her, but things all go wrong from there. He is being put away in some sort of center to get rid of his 'gayness', while Mary turns out to be pregnant. From that moment on, Mary starts having doubts with some of the Christian values she grew up with. She more and more starts rejecting friend and as beautiful as knowing all as bitchy Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), and starts hanging out with some of the other outcasts, such as crippled Roland (Macauly Culkin) and no good, smoking Jewish girl Cassandra (Eva Amurri). Other characters who play a significant role are Mary's mother, Pastor Skip who she has an eye for and his son, Patrick (Patrick Fugit). So that's the outline right there. Now what does this movie intend? Throughout the movie the main issue is Christian hypocrisy. Hilary Faye says she wants to save everybody so they can become 'good Christians', but meanwhile is treating some of her friends like dirt. Pastor Skip preaches that one should love another like yourself, but condemns homosexuality. Furthermore it seems he, as a married man, has feelings for Mary's mother. This is all a pretty one-sided and inconclusive view on Christianity, agreed. The question you need to ask yourself is: is this pure satirical comedy, or is it truly meant as anti-Christian. After answering that question you can also ask yourself if Christians should be offended watching this film. Those aren't simple questions. At times, you feel the movie is going somewhere. It's when Hilary Faye is throwing a bible at Mary, who responds by holding it in her hand shouting 'This is not a weapon!'. It's when Mary's gay boyfriend from the beginning comes to the prom with his boyfriend, claiming that 'God wants us to be different and think for ourselves' (I lost the exact words, but it came down to this). It's at times as this, and the more comical scenes (Pastor Skip's 'getting down with Jesus' or Mary's friends trying to do an exorcism on her) the movie most definitely is watchable. But, at other times, 'Saved' is unfairly attacking Christians as being hypocritical, narrow-minded and downright mean. The movie should have been more balanced on that point. Maybe it should have pictured the struggles of Pastor Skip in this better. Furthermore, making Hilary Faye such a bitchy character in the end was way over the top, even though Mandy Moore is playing her character with joy and success. Maybe one of those new actresses who somehow are all singing as well finally can act as well. I started out with the two views of 'Saved' one can have, and I still haven't found out for myself with who I agree more. So I think I'll just sit between Mr. Berardinelli and Mr. Ebert. I dunno, we could chat about the movies I guess... 5/10."
858,"i hated it; i hated it. the movie was so long and it was hard to follow. the sequels were OK. i feel that this movie was over rated way too much. so it had a good year in the seventies but come on how can this boring movie stand for 3 decades i just don't understand how that is possible. Marlon Brando has had much better roles in on the waterfront, A streetcar named desire, and don Juan Marco just to name a few. Pacino wasn't even that good. i much preferred him in Carlitos way and Donnie bras-co and who could forget Scarface. Pacino is getting typecast. i think the only reason he did Simone was to get away from the typecasting as a mobster or criminal. i have to say i can't blame him. Pacino is also getting typecast as a cop i mean insomnia come on"
8970,"Awesome! Best of the Year!; I know this film is up for a few Oscars and since Pirates of the Caribbean won 0 last year, this has GOT to be Johnny's movie! I can't believe how awesome little Peter's acting was! He was perfect for that role. I expect to see him in more movies later. I'm only 13 and this movie is the BEST I've EVER seen! It's not any stupid funny stuff like Napoleon Dynamite had. I'm not one for 'stupid funny' movies. I love this movie more than anything I've ever seen. Maybe Pirates of the Caribbean is my 2nd favourite movie... but Johnny Depp is the best actor of all time! Especially for kids my age, if you don't like Stupid-Funny movies, you should see this! There were about 5 little boys who came to see this and I think they all liked it. And if parents want to take their kids to the Movie of the Year, they won't be bored. 10 Stars!!!!"
8361,"Some good and some bad science; If you want to learn about climate change, go to a library. If you want an action/adventure movie watch this film. There are lots of problems with the film, but also lots of good points. Flesh can and does freeze within minutes of exposure to cold air, especially if there is a wind and if the skin is moist. My biggest problem is with the wolves. The escaped wolves would not have attacked the humans because if they can sense the impending storm, they would run away from the area. I also think they would have been more likely to attack the other arctic species, like moose and polar bears, than the humans. The climate change is hokey, it should have been stretched over weeks or years to make it more realistic."
8830,"Actually an improvement over part 1; The first 'Anaconda' may have had it's cast (with Jennifer Lopez, John Voigt, Eric Stoltz and Owen Wilson), 'Anacondas, The Hunt for the Blood Orchid' offers more fun and some pretty cool effects. When a drug-company finds out the Blood Orchid can extend human life, a group is set out to find it somewhere in the Asian bush, as it only blooms once in seven years. Soon, as you would expects, their numbers are going down... Amusing flick with some great looking snails, but the problems come with the acting. Johnny Messner isn't much of a hero, Matthew Marsden is a disappointing bad guy and it just hurts to see KaDee Strickland act... she must be of the worst around. But if you don't look too closely, you might have a fun evening after all... 5/10."
527,Spielberg's masterpiece; Personally I find this is Spielberg's masterpiece. Showing the monstrosities that took place during the 2nd world war. Of all the holocaust movies that have ever been made this is the best by far because this movie has it all showing the emotions of the different people. Even the sadistic Amon Goeth has emotions he just has problems handling them. The way he shows the inhuman things that took place is just spine chilling. Its the best movie of its kind and should be in any top 10 of the best movies ever where any masterpiece belongs. If you haven't watched this movie yet you shouldn't be reading this but on your way to the video store to get this movie. 10/10
7065,"The number of 10's; People commend style over substance with a heavy hand. Or maybe it is the perverse substance they really do condone. Either way, this film does not deserve such consummate praise as a 10 rating."
3739,how has this film not made it to DVD or video?; like fine champagne. Every scene is well constructed with beautiful dialogue. The script is worth reading. The performances fine. And a Lubitsch touch or 12 for good measure. There are too many good things to list. I check the revival listings every week and if it is playing work my schedule around seeing this. how has this film not made it to DVD or video?
1798,"Could have been a Hot B-movie!!; Everybody should just relax and enjoy watching a red hot, middle aged Momma's sexual jealousy over her beautiful daughter in law. The photography was great, loved the rural location (without the stupid horses), and Gwyneth and Jessica look as good as they ever have. The problem is that the director tried too hard for believability, and that resulted in a very average, plodding, sometimes laughably bad movie. If they had taken it over the top, like what you find in good novels, (torture, perversion), then we would have had a classic. Its a shame they held back because Jessica and Gwyneth looked amazing. Who cares if their performances weren't great? Their screen presence made up for it. They were ripe for a deliciously violent, twisted older woman/younger woman B-movie and the director blew it. (Check out Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek in ""Carrie."" They set the standard for over the top, twisted mother-daughter action.)"
27513,"Dark and Disturbing; This film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour. Loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in Vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film. For me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode, closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the 'slags' flat. You will be gripped and I hope horrified by this film. I hated it but I felt compelled to see it through. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 for displaying 'man' as he sometimes is."
8784,"Garden State; One of the best independent films i have seen yet. The message of the movie is basically ""Home is those who love you"". Zach B. directed the movie and it turned out a lot better than i expected. He also wrote the story/ script and it was magnificent. It's not ""Disneyfied"" or sugar coated. It is what would happen if it were a real life situation and that brought a humbleness to the film that i haven't seen in a film for a while. There was no special effects or crazy plot, it was simply great on pure talent. I also like the music picked for the movie. The Shins...excellent. Natalie Portman did a wonderful job and truly brought out the character in this role. I love the story line, the acting, and the hidden messages throughout the movie. Best movie i have seen in 2004, and probably 2005."
30816,"Hunh?; I've never seen an earlier version of ""Phantom"" so I didn't know the story apart from ""there's a disfigured guy running around the the Paris Opera"". Now that I've seen the movie, I still don't know the story. I thought the theater I was in had a pretty decent sound system, but I caught perhaps 10% of the dialog. Not enough to figure out what was going on. Christine and the Viscomte (Raoul?) I got. Christine and the Phantom I had no idea. The Phantom kidnaps her and she doesn't run away first chance she gets? No idea why. The masked ball was the low point for me, I thought Baz Luhrmann had wandered in and taken over (not a good thing, I watched about 20 minutes of Moulin Rouge before ejecting that tape) with Michael Jackson's choreographer. The Phantom's voice was not up to the level of the others. There were movie audio conventions that were ignored that made it even more confusing. Usually when a voice is sort-of everywhere, it's meant to be part of the background. The first time Christine hears the Phantom, I had no idea she was supposed to. For me, it was like having a character notice the narrator. I found the apparent age of the characters confusing. The Viscomte and the Phantom looked to be about the same age until the Phantom's mask is removed near the end. How did his hair go from black and slick to gray and stringy? Yeah, mostly confused."
8062,"if you're expecting the Texas chainsaw murders......; .....you'll be very disappointed by this film. on the other hand, if you're interested in a very perceptive character study, ""dahmer"" hits all the right notes. i didn't want to see anything graphic, no body parts in the freezer, and, thankfully, the writer didn't bother with the more sensational aspects of the crimes. we all know what happened. what has always intrigued me is the why and the how. the portrayal of dahmer was done so well, even if it was inaccurate, it still made for for very compelling watching. the acting was outstanding. the intention was obviously to keep everything low key, and to hit all the right psychological notes. there was more than enough tension for me around the stories of the one victim and then the boy who got away. unlike some of the other viewers who posted, i was not looking for a big, exciting gorefest. i was left with a bleak, unsettled feeling -- exactly what i feel the filmmaker intended. having dahmer walk through the woods into his future, a future we all know about, worked perfectly."
26840,"The Beatles Go Yakuza!; This is a strange movie. Notice that I didn't say ""strange LITTLE movie"". It is not a ""little"" movie. It has something to say... But it doesn't have the usual message one would get from an organized crime film. Much of the movie is simply play between adult males, kind of wacky like a Beatles film. This play occurs while the men are being hunted and killed. It is a remarkable contrasts. And, this lull in the action would be death to a film with a poor director; however, Takeshi manages to do very well with it. There are scenes of violence...fairly realistic scenes. Instead of the BOOM of absurdly high caliber guns, there is the ""pop pop"" of normal handguns. The chaos of gun battles is done very well here. It's violence, with a sense of humor... I think that the funniest part of the picture occurs on a bus shortly after one of the veterans is stabbed in the stomach by a new recruit. The stabber asks his sour faced victim if he'd like one of the refreshments being offered. The other man stares incredulously and states, with sort of a whine, ""You stabbed me in the stomach and it still hurts"". The other man shrugs and continues eating his popsicle... Such is life in the Yakuza..."
6954,"Who ewer said that story is deadwas wrong!!!!!; I went to see this movie only because it won Best Screenplay award at Cannes Film Festival. I don't like French language and idea of spending 2 hours listening to it was very unpleasant. I still don't like French language but this is one of the best movies I seen in my life time. Uncompromising screenplay about the things we all know to be truth, but are reluctant to admit it. Until we find are self's face to face with it. Satirical look at modern society and the things in it, that is for most people taboo topics. Emotionally touching drama about life, choices and mistakes we made in it. The first movie with bolls since Fight Club. And it's Canadian!!! Yes Canadian!!! Go figure"
3253,"Wayne's World: A Classic to America's Youth; WAYNE'S WORLD has evolved to classic status among the youth of America. Wayne (MIKE MYERS) and Garth (DANA CARVEY) are the heroes that carry this film to greatness. WAYNE'S WORLD is a film that will always be remembered. If one was to make a time capsule in the early 1990s, WAYNE's WORLD would most definitely be included. The style, music, and expressions of WAYNE'S WORLD represent the youth of the early 90s, that are still looked up to, by the youth of today. WAYNE'S WORLD is the story of two men, Wayne and Garth, who appear to be in their twenties, and their public access TV show, entitled Wayne's World. Their show includes heavy metal, sexy girls, crude humor, and language and phrases such as, ""party on"" and ""rock out,"" characteristic of the early 90s youth. Although the typical teenager of the early 90s may not have modeled his/her behavior directly from the characters of WAYNE'S WORLD, WAYNE'S WORLD has significantly influenced many teenagers' attitudes, expressions, and perception of what it means to be ""cool."" WAYNE'S WORLD is unique on several fronts. For one, the director, PENELOPE SPHEERIS and writer, MIKE MEYERS use many innovative techniques to express the plot and tell the story. Wayne and Garth walk of screen or under tables on several occasions to whisper to the camera and the viewer, what they are thinking or something that they wish to expose to the viewer but not other characters. This filming technique enhances the viewers connection and appreciation for the characters. It allows for viewers to become more involved in the film and its characters and enter ""Wayne's World"" for the 95 minutes of this film. WAYNE'S WORLD, despite what rating it gets on IMDb or from other critics, will always remain a classic among teenagers. Wayne and Garth are the admiral heroes who refused to sell out and be induced by the pressures of the real business and marketing world. Instead they created Wayne's World, where teenagers, partying and heavy metal reign supreme. WAYNE'S WORLD will be remembered as the story of two losers who succeed, and make the big time, without selling out their ideas, and original inspiration. As every genre and generation has its classics to relate other films to, WAYNE'S WORLD is a classic among the youth of America."
4691,"Revenge of the 80's: Apocaplypse Now!; Def-Con 4 (1985) was a surprisingly good low budget take on World World 3. Despite the low budget and the cast of minor actors, it works. The landscape and the situations the residents on a heavily radioactive Earth are a lot similar to what it would actually be like compared to most movies that were made during this time. A nuclear warhead equipped space station is circling above the stratosphere when the unthinkable happens. Nuclear holocaust! In a pickle, the crew aboard the space station must make several decisions in order for them to survive in a world that's nearly impossible to survive on. Can they do it? What kind of world awaits their return? A watchable film that will give you a good time if in the right mood. Recommended."
5210,"Normal cult(the kind that gets funny because its bad); Real cult movie which has it all. Sex, gore, guts , guns and even i find it weird to say this but incest. The story goes like this. A professor has found an ancient crypt. The story says that the people who were buried there had found a way to live forever. Upon trying to open the crypt the zombies are released and u can guess what happens next. The professor had invited some people to come and see his new discovery. When they arrive its like some sort of orgy(but no real porn). After the first night the zombies start appearing and slaying people with all the usual blood and guts, real in your face gore. And lets not forget one of the last scenes between a mother and her son who has just turned into a zombie. The son who looked like he wanted to have sex with his mother before hasn't forgotten this in when he turned into the zombie stage. Funny stuff. Ps: i didn't know your head can be cut of so easy(in this move its like cutting through butter."
8947,"misunderstood by too many people; Grantes; it's not possible to make a movie anywhere near perfect, but this one has been so misunderstood that I created an account and am writing my first review ever in its defense. If you don't like a movie that doesn't play by your rules (the characters must develop, the scenes must be sequential, ghosts can't leave their haunting grounds, any unresolved ending means a sequel...), then buy tickets to movies you know you'll like instead of getting disappointed and complaining. I don't mean to offend any of the readers or reviewers that thought badly of the movie, but the overwhelming negativity I found to be based more on false assumptions and adherence to non-universal traditions --spoilers ahead-- For those who didn't pay enough attention and got confused, here are some things people missed that are a little essential for keeping up with the plot (in no particular order or completeness): Yoko's jaw, which she is later without, is the bloody chunk in the attic. The gasoline used to burn the house was brought in by the detective. The lighter--also to burn the house--was not the heroine's, it was her boyfriend's (who we did in fact see smoking in the Buddhist mourner scene). The spirits are not ghosts as we think of them; other reviews have gone into depth to explain that. The creepy hair is a Japanese spirit trademark, like doors closing themselves in American horror. Bill Pullman's suicide is explained very thoroughly throughout the movie, if you remember all the parts and link them together. Another thing I would like to point out is the extreme differences between theater traditions around the world. Americans prefer a plot-based, character-driven experience. In Native American storytelling, in contrast, characters routinely change their names and appearances. Japanese kabuki theater purposefully avoided plot entirely. What I'm trying to say is that this movie is very easy to misunderstand when viewed in the American horror paradigm. There are thematic materials and deep traditions all over the place, and it really is a scary movie if you get into it and ignore the schoolchildren around you laughing at it, but if you don't pick up on (or at least accept) the deeper meanings then a lot of the experience is lost. The movie was (re)made for American audiences, so it isn't quite as quirkily Japanese as it could be; so just let the idiosyncrasies draw you in and then scare you ####less."
143027,"Pretty Good; I was surprised how good this movie was. It's not the best movie I've seen but was pretty good. Some of the magic tricks could have been done a little better. Neat effects in some parts though. I would recommend this movie to anyone wondering if they should see it. Especially if they like magic. Almost of the actors gave a great performance. The main plot line is pretty far fetched in that magic is real. One way they could have greatly improved this movie was to have a few more magic tricks. The magic also doesn't have the feel of watching a performer on the street where there is no preparation. I'd say that only about half of the tricks were done right there on camera. The rest involved film tricks and such. It was a pretty good story line. If you've like the other Disney Channel shows, you'll like this one."
34057,"Great film!; I am a huge Godzilla fan, I grew up with Godzilla, I just love seeing this awesome monster just destroy cities and fighting other monsters. I like his enemies as well but Godzilla is the Icon! This Godzilla film is one most unique Godzilla films and its a great one. The story is very good and I really like the way Godzilla looks in this film. I love it when he roars and moves his tail. As for his enemy The Smog Monster AKA Hedorah he too is awesome. Its cool how the monster attacks and I also love it when he moves. The fights between the Kinbg of the Monsters and Hedorah is really good. The acting by the film's human stars are also good. The music is very good. I really love this Godzilla film for many reasons. If you love Godzilla I strongly recommend that you do what I did and buy Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster today!"
1968,"Uh, so where's the ""great movie""?; If a spoiler is defined as how the characters make out in the end, there is probably one or two here. Now, I was flipping between a few things when I saw this on TV so I didn't see every minute of it, but I can describe my reaction in two words: Thoroughly unimpressed. I just didn't like the direction the story was going, almost from the get-go. Why, at 17 minutes in, would any of them have any reason to cover for the guy who took the screw out of the door? It went more or less downhill from there, and just when I thought it was about to redeem itself and become this ""great"" movie everyone who was a teen in the '80s says it is, it didn't. Bender is the type of student that would torture me in high school, if such a stereotype had actually existed, and to that degree. My high school self would have wanted to alternately try to beat him up (and fail spectacularly) or go tell the supervisor what was going on. He comes falling through the ceiling? Yeah, sure, like I'm going to cover for that. The movie revisits, or perhaps imposes for the first time, the ""values"" that supposedly everyone has in high school, meaning none. Look down on virginity, smoke pot, and swear enough to turn March air in Illinois even bluer. Oh, and you can find a guy/girl by getting a total makeover and/or being one of the chicks who dig bad boys. Anthony Michael Hall's character was alternately overexploited (is that redundant?) and underused. OK, so maybe a flare gun was all he had access to, not an unreasonable position for 20 years ago. But the revelation of that during the conversation pretty much ruined whatever the movie had going for it at that point. Then he willingly writes ""the essay"" for the group? Mm-hm. And on top of that, they expect me to believe that the nerd can dance. If you think about it, his situation is one of the most dated parts of the movie, since today he would probably have been shuttled off to a psychiatrist, put on Prozac, reported to the police, or all of the above. (The 'underused' part comes from the gymnastics one must do in the script to get a nerd in detention in the first place, which is where the flare gun came in, and then there's the problem of what to do with him after that.) I'm not dismissing the possibility that I just don't ""get it"" for generational reasons, as high school came 15 years later for me. I'm also not dismissing the possibility that I don't ""get it"" because perhaps my experience and angst aren't like most people's experiences and angsts, or because being in a small high school doesn't lend itself to as deep divisions in the student body. (And Saturday detentions aren't part of the discipline.) If anything, this movie has confirmed two things: I am most emphatically not a member of Generation X, and I should've know I probably wouldn't like this movie given my loathing of that other alleged symbol of teen angst, ""Catcher in the Rye."""
6378,"Very good movie!; The Italian Job is an excellent film that boasts a excellent cast which includes Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, Edward Norton, Franky G, and Gawtti! The acting by all of these actors is pretty good. I liked how Wahlberg and Theron's relationship was. Theron was excellent in this film and she is becoming one of My favorite actresses! It was amazing to see Wahlberg, Stratham, and Franky G all together because they are all very muscular individuals. Gawtti had a really good performance and he reminded Me of the legendary wrestler Yokozuna. The action is really good and the car chases are excellent. The film is very exciting and the music by John Powell is great. F. Gary Gray has directed another good film. This is a great and thrilling film. If you like Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, Jason Statham and the rest of the cast I've mentioned above and exciting non-stop action films then I Strongly recommend this film!"
132294,"Too much shown cheesy creature; I still remember how I was curious to know how they could do a sequel to WATCHERS when I saw this movie on a shelf of the video-store. The curiosity grown when I looked at the back of the cover and saw a gore scene not included in the cassette (which has no real bloody shots). Plus, the movie was forbidden for people under 18 - where the first one (here in Italy) was for all audiences. But what I saw wasn't that good I thought. This is not a remake of the original directed by Hess, but a second adaptation of the novel by Koontz (a quiet good horror novel, btw), more close to it (except for the character's names) than the previous. But it's still very far from the book. Besides some changes (this time there's only a scientist who tracks the beast), the main problem is that the monster's look is very far from being scary and the director had the bad idea to show it completely and very early in the story. In Hess' version, instead, we don't clearly see it and even if this is obtained through simple methods (POVs. shaky camera works, long shots in the fog), it works quiet well. Here Notz tries a little bit to create suspense (the creature's shadow on a wall wasn't that bad), but stops quiet early, preferring to show a guy in a cheesy suit who moves like an idiot. As the previous, the most incredible performance is delivered by the dog - and I mean it in a good way. I still wonder where that gore shot was supposed to be inserted in.."
142947,"eenie meenie, chilli beanie, the spirits are about to speak.; Spookies 9/10 This forgotten 80's flick deserves to be seen by b-horror movie fans who don't like to take things too seriously. It's funny as hell, but is also more creative, stylish, and unique than it has any right to be. In fact, it's a miracle this movie was even completed. Directors Thomas Doran and Brendan Faulkner were shooting a film called Twisted Souls, but were replaced by Eugenie Joseph, who decided to blend some of the scenes they shot with some new ones of her own. So Spookies is basically two different films, but you wouldn't know that from watching it. It's common in horror films for a bunch of morons to wonder into an old, dilapidated mansion for no reason except for pure boredom. Then, of course, they will all split up into separate groups and explore the entire house. This is common. However, it's not common for a low-budget 80's film to give us such an excellent, believable army of monsters. Here we have a cat-like henchman with a hook for a hand, a possessed woman conjuring evil with her beloved ouija board, wind-breaking muck-men who can be killed with wine, a grim reaper with glowing red eyes who can explode at any minute, a slimy little lizard-gremlin thing, a grotesque witch with icy-cold breath, an Oriental woman that can transform into a giant tarantula, a peculiar flashing blue light that causes instant aging, an adolescent boy-druid with fangs, a towering fleshless creature who strangles and electrocutes people at the same time, the neverending swarm of zombies, and much more. It's also not common for such a goofy film to have such a serious, pretty soundtrack. You can either love or hate this film, but you can't deny its ambition and originality. Watching Spookies is like walking through a haunted house during the Halloween season. Sometimes it's too dark to see anything and sometimes it's hard to understand what other people are saying, but you're having such an amazing time because you know that any second, something out-of-this-world will jump out and scare you. And you can tell that everybody working there is putting their hearts into it and trying their best to show you a good time. And you can't stop smiling. Unfortunately, Spookies has yet to find a home on DVD in the States, but for now, definitely keep an eye open for VHS copies. They are out there, trust me."
7899,"Kung Fu Gladiator Masterpiece; This is a sequel to director Yu Wang's 1971 film One-Armed Boxer (Dop bey kuan wan). Fung Sheng Wu Chi (Kang Kam), as the master of the flying guillotine, is a blind Ching Dynasty assassin, with a directive to quell potential rebels. After his two disciples were killed by Tien Lung (Yu Wang), the one-armed boxer (in the prequel), Fung has sworn revenge. Although many rightfully consider this film a masterpiece, if you're not much of a fan of martial arts fight sequences in films, you probably shouldn't bother with Master of the Flying Guillotine. That's because there isn't much screen time taken up by anything else. Beside the fights, there is very little action or dialogue. Every fight in Master of the Flying Guillotine is engaging, but the last two are probably the best. These are two of the best fight scenes I've seen in any film. We know right out of the gate that Master of the Flying Guillotine is going to be something special. The opening cinematography is beautiful, the introduction to Fung captivating, and we're quickly introduced to an ingeniously odd and sinister ""growling/grinding"" musical leitmotif for Fung, which is achieved by slowing down a musical recording (it's actually a song by the German band Neu!) As a leitmotif, the music reappears whenever Fung reappears, with all the impact and then some of Darth Vader's leitmotif music in the Star Wars films. There are two factors that make this film so remarkable overall. The first is the fantastic and brutal nature of the martial arts. In a lesser film, the fantasy aspects could easily be unintentionally funny. Here, they're just enthralling. Every fighter has some unique style and/or skill, and the extended ""kung fu gladiator"" tournament focuses on these, to our benefit. The second, less obvious factor, is the depth of characterization and implied, complex plot and backstory achieved by Yu Wang solely through the fight sequences. Even though 90-something percent of the film is just fight sequences, nothing is lacking. A 10 out of 10 from me."
139843,"Not great but good enough!; A shy and reluctant Theology high school teacher in Thessaloniki decides to solve his erection problem by consulting a doctor for the first time after two years. The doctor just replies that the problem can be solved by Ro 20 (&#929; 20). Ro 20 is played fabulously by Dimitris Starovas. He is a former psychologist (now operating his father's import export meat business) that uses company trucks as moving brothels. Ro 20 actually stands for ""Russian 20 years old"" which eventually means that Lakis Lazopoulos has to cheat on his wife to solve his problem. Lakis Lazopoulos portrays the shy theologist very well and he is instantly likable and Vassilis Haralabopoulos is good as the goofy ""sidekick"" who helps him through the movie. Jokes are present in each scene but what makes you laugh the most are the two main characters as well as the whole Ro 20 scenes. The movie turns a bit serious towards the end as Lazopoulos's character rethinks and makes some decisions to close with a good ending. Overall a standard N.W.O.G.C. (New Wave Of Greek Comedy) that doesn't give you straightforward jokes (as is the case in most NWOGC) and is good for an afternoon video."
5956,"Hard to believe but one of Scorcese's best; When I first saw this film I thought it would be just another blood and guts war film,but after i watched it i was mesmerized by it's raw power and unnerving violence.The cast is perfect except for Cameron Diaz who is good in her role but something about her just doesn't fit.But that's just a minor problem that is made up from Scorcese's masterful directing but what is really good about this film is Daniel Day Lewis as Bill The Butcher his performance is awesome and one of the most under appreciated roles in filmaking.What was also a surprise was the role by Leonardo Dicaprio which is great and his best so far.So all in all if you ever see this movie for rent my word of advice is RENT IT!!!!!"
6725,"A Higher Rating  please; Now I was only umm....13 or so but I remember seeing this movie about four times since it was a double feature with Thank God it's Friday. I had heard about the Beatles but I was never really a fan of their music. However, this film opened my hears to some great music and it was fun to watch. And yes, Peter Frampton was on top at that time and it was great seeing him sing those nice songs. The funny thing is I still don't really listen to the Beatles but when I remember this movie, I know they were the soundtrack for it and I want to see it again.Now I have not seen this film in over 20 years so I am sure my values and taste have changed a bit but I would recommend it for anyone wanting a fun movie to share with their children and enjoy the fantasy of the era and the music!"
78009,"Demy's Kitsch Fairy-Tale Vision; PEAU D'ANE has not been easy to find in the US, so the recent restoration has allowed fans of Jacques Demy's romantically-tinged films a chance to finally see it. The 1970 film turns out to be a true European fairy-tale film. The story is presented un-Disneyized, with many bizarre, even repellent components. The king's donkey produces riches, mainly coins and jewels, from its anus. And when his wife dies, the king wants to marry his own daughter, a concept met with only mild bewilderment. Surely for many, these and other details will seem strange and off-putting. Yet the original versions of many well-known fairy-tales are much more violent and bizarre than we would suspect from the typical Hollywood treatments they tend to get. The most distinguishing features of Demy's film are the production design and the music. Costumes, and especially sets in this film could often be described with no better a word than 'kitsch'. The king's throne is a huge, stuffed white cat that looks like something he won throwing darts at a carnival. Many objects that seem out of place in royal palaces are on display in the film, along with costumes that betray their true decade of origin. But this may be Demy's conscious intent, maybe the influence of the Nouvelle Vague, of which he was never more than a marginal participant. The film's climax contains the most blatantly anachronistic thing and pretty much convinces the viewer that the director never wants it forgotten that this is, after all, a movie. For some reason, the songs written for PEAU D'ANE by Michel Legrand have not become better known. Perhaps this is due to the relative obscurity of the film itself. It's a typical Legrand score, using and re-using a handful of tunes throughout. Fans of the composer will not mind, since the songs are characteristically infectious and even haunting. The cast is populated by some of the most attractive and interesting performers available to French film at the time: Catherine Deneuve, Jacques Perrin (who would go on to direct WINGED MIGRATION), Jean Marais (the great Cocteau collaborator), Delphine Seyrig and Micheline Presle. A one-of-a-kind movie from an underrated director."
47,"Grisly, Disturbing, and well created thriller; Se7en is a film that is often compared to Silence Of The Lambs. Both films involve serial killers. In both films the serial killers have a method of choosing their next victim, and both films are dark and disturbing. In my opinion, they're both good and they're different types of films. (Spoilers) Se7en starts out with detective David Mills(Brad Pitt) and Detective Lt. William Somerset(Morgan Freeman) investigating the murder of an obese man. He had been dead for a while and had the word gluttony written on the floor of his apartment. The next day there is another murder with the name of the second sin written on the floor. This is when the detectives figure out there is a serial killer on the loose, and he is picking his victims according to the seven sins. In the rest of the film Mills and Somerset are on a path ridden with danger and suspense in trying to track down the killer. I don't want to spoil anything else for you. The killings that the detectives come across are grisly and disturbing. Se7en definitely has a long lasting effect on you for a long time after you see it. The film is well created as it sends you into the deepest darkest corners of the human mind and never goes soft. The climax is the best part as it keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat, and when you find out what happens you'll be in for a shock. I highly recommend se7en, but only if your stomach can handle it."
8957,"This is a truly awesome film! Great change in the very typical horror genre; Saw is a truly mesmerizing film ,full of suspense & very solid acting from Cary Elwes,Danny Glover, and from the writer/actor Leigh Waddell. It definitely gives you the creeps & makes you want to scream "" Watch Out!"" several times over to the characters on the screen. Though,it could've been a tad bit gorier (thank God for director's cut DVD's) the death scenes are truly masterful in their grotesqueness & are ingenious in their just plain awfulness of just imaging having to die in this fashion. Definitely, if you like horror or even suspense whodunits don't walk RUN TO SEE this film. Great work for a low budget film that made a lot of money. Can't wait for Saw 2. I just hope they do it justice. ***** out of *****"
5770,"The Cinema of Abel Ferrara; Ms. 45 (1981) was an interesting view on the revenge flicks that were popular during the mid 70's to the early 80's. Abel Ferrara and his co-conspirator Nicholas St. John follow the life of a mute dress worker (Zoe Lund) who snaps one day after being raped twice. She kills her last attacker and keeps his gun. After seeing the grim world around her and the loss of her mental faculties, she decides to do a hunting. A strange but highly enjoyable film that takes exploitation films to a whole new level. The gritty direction by Abel Ferrara and the smart writing from Nicholas St. John elevate this movie above most of the trash that was produced during this time period. The star, Zoe Lund posses some unearthly beauty and she has that certain stuff to make the material work. Not many other actresses could have pulled this off but she some how manages to. If you can find an uncut version of this movie I advise you to go out and get it. This is one of the best vigilante movies you'll ever watch. I have to highly recommend this film. It's Abel Ferrara doing what he does best. Street level film making!"
85728,"brilliant movie banned by HBO?; This movie was an original film made by HBO and was shown in 1997 and then disappeared. Why? Too many un-PC remarks is my guess. At one point Dan Hedaya (head of the CNN look-alike NetworkNews) yells that somebody needs to get the White House on the phone ""unless Tokyo has foreclosed on it!"". The story is brilliantly created and the cast is amazing. Look at the cast and ask yourself how this film could just disappear. The mayor of Los Angeles is giving a speech, and the newsroom is frantically looking for a translator. but NOT to translate into Spanish. No, to translate HIS speech into English. I say shame on HBO for letting this film slide into oblivion, You can still find it, used, on VHS but it never went to DVD. You cannot buy it from HBO. You gotta ask yourself why..."
8977,"A good movie; Too much history for 3 hours of movie. It might be right that Oliver Stone has focused some aspects of Alexander, such as his bisexuality or his apparent weakness that are not as relevant as other aspects of his personality. Nevertheless I think this is a great movie. Good performance from Collin MacFarrel, Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer. Anthony Hopkin's performance is good as usual. I am still impressed by the effort of Mr Stone to show in the 3 hours movie the complete story of Alexander. If I had to highlight something of the movie it would be how well is described the complicated relationship with their parents. Well done Angelina, I didn't expected such a good performance as Olimpia."
8897,"This film's statement is strong.; Now,last night (1/15/05),I finally got to see this ""hard to find on video"" mini-epic. I have not read the play but unlike what some one else stated here,I was not lost,bored or confused by this film. If anything I was incredibly intrigued! When I watch a film I watch for the storyline (and any film I see had better have one!) Now,I did know going in,that this would be one of those films made at the end of the 60's to early 70s,that of course,look like they didn't have an extensive budget but make up for it (sometimes) with good acting and scripts. The storyline is very simple,even without reading or seeing the play. The Greek Soldiers have killed all the male soldiers and men in general,they have slaughtered all but one child and all the women are going to be forced on a boat to Greece to serve as slave labor and or concubine. The ""flowery"" speeches and other dialogue may sometimes be in ""ancient"" form but the truly involved viewer need only see the expression of their face and hear the tone of their voice. I was truly caught by surprise when Hector (the boy) was thrown from the cliff. I thought when the soldier wandered off with him that we were to logically assume that he'd been done in already. When the soldier tousled the boy's hair,I thought he was going to tell him to run away! Katharine Hepburn is no over-actor,she's fascinating to watch in this film as she is in any other of her ""Oscar"" films. Maybe it's not Academy level,but it's powerful enough,especially at the end where she lays Hector to rest and then (after the burning of the City Of Troy) and before they're marched off to the awaiting boats,she falls down along with the rest of the women in a vividly moving scene. From this,I gathered that despite their fate,these women were going to stay strong and never give up hope,even in the face of those who have destroyed everything they hold dear. It's a 10 star movie in my view! One thing to remember when you review a film for this kind of forum,stick to the plot and the acting and forget about trivial things like the women all wearing the same thing. Why would they not? They have virtually nothing left! Even if there were a mild difference,their clothes are rags anyway. To all of you,""really""..and I mean ""really"" watch this movie. Anyone with a brain can get this movie's point,as long as you have patience and or simply want to see something different. (END)"
8749,"This movie is, well, very French.; Lots of questions come up about this movie: First, when is a film/story worth spending four hours with. It would seem to me to be necessary that it is an outstanding film which this one isn't. Unless you are not familiar with the artistic process of life-drawing and could be fascinated with it as a spectator sport, then don't rent this movie, you will be bored to tears. I multi-tasked during most of it. I have been an artist and the studio is familiar to me but I wouldn't impose the practice of sketching a nude on anyone. Of course there is the prurient interests in looking for extended amounts of time at a beautiful woman naked and if that's your thing then you will be richly rewarded. Second, did the model get paid for her modeling or is this another movie about how we should all adore the artist so much that we give our time to him? I saw no money trading hands which would have raised the status of the model to some kind of equity. I might just me too American and too much of a feminist (I am male) but it seems that the French have this habit of adoring their women as long as they are attractive sex objects at the total disposal of male projects. That is what this movie is about. The two female characters are completely devoted to the rather pathetic artist. The movie was made in the nineties. Shame on you Rivette. But then you are one of the ""New Wave"" generation when women were treated repeatedly as sexual geegaws for the male protagonists, so perhaps we should forgive you. Thirdly, does anyone think his art was that good to deserve all this reverence? It seems pretty undergraduate life-drawing class quality to me. This is another thing about French culture - after they have gotten rid of God and the king the artist takes his place. In this movie the artist lives in the largest and imposing villa of the village. Are we to think that this man's talent has provided him with enough success that he can live like a king? Fourthly, are we to believe that the few conversations the artist has with his model has brought them both into some kind of personal transformation? I would need a lot more from them than what I saw on screen. We are to take the creative process of this man as so important that it is effecting all the characters (including a ""sister"" of the boyfriend who ends up at the villa for no apparent reason). To risk being called a franco-phobe (actually I love France and French Culture, but it does have certain qualities that distinguish it from, say, Swedish or Swiss or German), the French do seem to lean to the hysterical side of human functioning - like Liz (the artist's wife) telling the art dealer how she hated him and then calmly goes about the conversation, smiling and kissing him when he leaves. I found lots of emotion in this movie that wasn't carrying cognitive content - like we, as the viewers, are to think that emotion alone makes a film complex and deep. I'm sorry its just a little too much to take. The movie is beautifully filmed, as is the tradition of the French, but it's aspiration to depth doesn't quite work for me. And please, four hours!"
7454,"bland, predictable, bad acting... get the picture?; This is one of the more forgettable movies I have seen in a while... The movie is fun... I'll give it that, but so many things are overdone that the whole effort comes across as being way over the top. And the normally talented Kate Beckinsale's Romanian accent is scarcely believable. Most of the characters in fact are either cliché or pulled off very badly, especially Dracula, he looks so much like professor snape from harry potter that I expected him to pull out a wand at any moment. If you want a real Dracula look at gary oldman's incredible performance and the makeup job they did on him, THAT's a scary Dracula. Special effects are OK, adherance to reality isn't. There aren't many movies that make me shake my head in disbelief, but this is one of them. The splicing of almost all the major horror characters of the days of old is also something worth mentioning, the only one missing is the mummy, and fortunately they didn't put him in there. I guess they didn't have the creativity to come up with a decent plot so instead they just cut and paste a bunch of done-to-death characters together in the hope of coming up with something ""new"". All in all a pitiful attempt at a monster movie that will soon be forgotten. The best way to watch this thing is get it for free somewhere with free rental, and then watch it at a frat house with generous amounts of beer in between."
8368,"amazing.....truly stunning!; First of all let me say that i am a 32 year old man who has never read a harry potter book before, but i love sword and sorcery stories so i've seen all the potter movies. This movie was amazing...the cinematography was the most stunning work i have ever seen on film(and i'm a movie buff and photographer)! It was a visual feast for the eyes...the other potter movies never gave the feel of a magical environment,this did.The night scenes were so beautifully shot that that you felt immersed in an outerworldly realm of magic both good and bad every second.The overall story telling was brilliant and well paced, and i found the story to be very dark and mature.Some moments are a bit too scary for small children ,but everyone should find something to like.This one was about maturing as people and wizards.....and the 3 kids have matured as actors as much as there characters have on screen.It is a travesty that this director doesn't continue with the series. To the potter fans that say this doesn't closely resemble the book, get over it!!! No movie can ever match what you visualized in your mind. As a stand alone movie this was a masterwork."
31184,"Trouble in Utopia; 'Appleseed,' reportedly a landmark animated feature in its marrying of 2D animation and 3D landscapes, draws its syntax from more basic sources such as Hollywood cinema and MTV. As visually breathtaking as it often is, its style is very kinetic, hyperkinetic -- think Michael Bay on speed. I had very little idea what was happening during each action sequence, and resigned myself to waiting until afterward for some explanation or play-by-play via dialogue. The movie opens with such a sequence. First, it surveys a devastated metropolitan landscape shrouded in the grey of night, calling to mind 'Blade Runner' (what post-apocalyptic film doesn't call to mind 'Blade Runner,' these days?), and before we can much admire the digitally shimmering detail of this environment, large machines and robo-warriors appear. Explosions ensue, and a female soldier called Deunan Knute, the kind of name that screams ""Make me a trademark name,"" jumps into the action. I couldn't tell you in detail what happens, though, because I couldn't follow it. What I do know, however, is that Deunan is knocked unconscious and whisked away to the utopian metropolis of Olympus, a sprawling crowd of skyscrapers and bridges recalling Lang's 'Metropolis,' Spielberg's 'A.I.' and the 'Weird Science' comics of the '50s. The city is populated by humans and bioroids, human-like creatures who are designed without the capacity for anger, envy and biological reproduction, intended to instill a 'balance' scientifically determined to prevent the human race from destroying itself. The city is run by two forces, basically: the human ""regular army,"" and the bioroids. Overseeing everything is a large, incandescent sphere called ""Gaia,"" informed by a band of elders whose dialogues with one another advise it of the proper path. The ""regular army"" is commanded by Uranas, who wants to rid Olympus of the bioroids and regain human control. It sounds a lot like 'I, Robot,' and indeed, there's a lot of watered-down philosophizing borrowed from the more popular faces of 20th century philosophy and science fiction. The parallels to Greek mythology are heavy-handed and not nearly as edifying as they'd like to be. If the action sequences are extreme, so is the expository dialogue. Characters explain and explain, almost as though they're reading from the film's own Cliffs Notes. The American actors hired to dub the dialogue sound particularly flat. The aesthetic qualities of the film are varied, but mostly with good results. 3D models were constructed for the film and photographed digitally, and sometimes this is striking (particularly the shots that are indistinguishable from actual footage, such as those of a hyperreal ocean), and other times, ugly and tarnished by digital artifacts such as aliasing (when diagonal lines appear pixelated and take on the shape of a staircase). The cel-shading is the most impressive quality, resulting in a remarkably fluid sense of light and shadows that is rarely seen in animated films. The movie engages intermittently. I liked the daylit skyline and exterior details of Olympus, particularly the floating vehicles and the mirror-like causeways on which they travel. It's hard to care much about what happens on screen, though. Much of the movie plays like a non-interactive video game. The movie's technical innovation is rendered almost trivial by the creators' lack of imagination, sappy use of pop music and generally uninspired writing, yielding none of the resonance or wonder of recent triumphs of Japanese animation such as 'Spirited Away.'"
136586,"one of the best ironic and comic scenes i have ever seen in a film; This film was an introduction to Czech film for me whilst visiting Prague, last summer. And i have to say that I was impressed. The best part of the film is the taxi driver, passenger and the passenger's wife...watch the film to fully understand but it was definitely one of the best ""audience-knows-what is happening-but-characters -don't,scenes i have ever seen! The film consisted of different story lines woven together, though it was hard to see the connection of some of them, especially the world-war II pilot. The cinematography and views of Prague were great and some of the small insights and details in some of the characters were universal, and therefore very recognisable. Definitely worth another viewing on DVD!"
171771,"Better than expected; This film, unlike Furtado's previous feature (The man who copied) is very well paced. It's a teenage flick really, although you might think otherwise because of its title. The crime-mystery element in the plot is only a diversion from the main theme: an underdog story. There are some really funny lines in it, and it's a good thing the director decided to make it a ""real movie"", without any miraculous deus ex-machina solutions and unnecessary plot ""twists"". Hopefully his next film will be even better. The acting is very good, and at times the situations portrayed bothered me, because they seemed so real. The ending could have been better but it makes you leave the theater satisfied. Good entertainment, but nothing extraordinary."
4224,"Brilliant action film from the start!; What a film! One of my fav action films of modern time. DMX out plays and out acts Seagul in my opinion. Which is rare to see from rappers who turn their hand to acting.Don't get me wrong though, Seagul does deliver. Seeing as though the other reviews have pretty much got everything covered about this hit film, i won't go on too much! Some excellent music (if your into the rap/hiphop scene) inc the main soundtrack by DMX himself (An interesting cover with a rap angle on it of Bill Withers/Al ????'s 'Ain't no sunshine') Which i think is a really good version (and i do love the original as well) The rest of the cast have been cast carefully and all actors are perfect for their respective rolls. The acting is above-average (Seagul mainly concentrates on his fighting technique as usual, however DMX is fantastic. Really good story line of corruption within the police force. Good Cops,bad cops sort of thing. Highly entertaining from the word go-right to the final scene. With a fantastic music score,flashy cars,fantastic fight scenes(both from kung fu master 'Seagul' and rapper 'DMX')to its pretty good storyline.I'd give this film 8 and a half out of 10. If you haven't seen this film yet-I'd highly recommend you watching it on DVD as the extras (Deleted scenes,making of,behind the scenes and music video) are also all highly entertaining. Best viewed and heard through a 5.1 surround sound set up, as it enhances the film and its action further through its quality sound! I'm sure one of the other reviewers have told you about the story line so this is just about my personal thoughts on this highly entertaining film! Definitely Recommended. (Also:- Training Day and SWAT as part of the cop/action collection) ********"
26546,"Hong Kong awesomeness; Version: Cantonese, with English subtitles (by SBS) I borrowed this, and several other movies, from a friend a couple of months ago. Most of these movies I'd already seen, except for this. I can't think of why I hadn't seen it: It had been taped from SBS, it was an action / horror / comedy from Hong Kong, and it was awesome. The movie follows Master Gau (Ching-Ying Lam), a vampire hunter who discovers at a reburial that the corpse has turned into a vampire. Along with his two assistants, Chou (Siu-hou Chin) and Man Choi (Ricky Hui), Master Gau has to stop this vampire and any other demons, but Chou is being distracted by a succubus and Man Choi is turning into a vampire. OK, I'll admit that the plot was rather confusing. The above is how I understood it, but who needs a plot when you have vampires, and kung-fu, and evil lady-demons who detach their own head for no apparent reason? I know I don't. Awesome. The martial-arts scenes are the best parts of the movie, but the horror / comedy sequences are still entertaining. Anyone interested in kung-fu movies should check this out for Siu-hou Chin's performance alone. The guy is incredible, and puts on some great fights. 9/10 - Anyone who is fan of Hong Kong action movies should check it out."
9006,"Story - enhh, picture - amazing.; ""The Garden of Allah"" was one of the first feature length, 3-strip Technicolor films. To correct a previous poster the first Technicolor feature (after Disney's 5-year exclusivity deal) was 1935's ""Becky Sharp"" which was a costume drama that used the color for it's garish color costumes. ""The Garden of Allah"" looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows. It must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life. Unfortunately, the film does not stand up to the cinematography. That being said, the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat."
2167,"A well written Action/Horror film!; WESLEY SNIPES is BLADE, a vampire hunter with a twist, he too is also part vampire. He has all of their strengths & none of their weaknesses, a fighter that the vampires call a ""Day Walker"". Partnered with an old man called WHISTLER, whom took him off of the streets when he was young, Whistler taught Blade to control his hunger & taught him to fight back at his nastier brethren. Blade's goal is to hunt for a maniacal vampire leader called DEACON FROST who is about to unleash vampire gods that will give him rule over the world. He was responsible for attacking Blade's mother when she was pregnant, putting Blade in the condition that he's in. However during a raid in a night club filled with vampires, Blade manages to ""toast"" one of the creatures, but was unable to finish him off, when the police arrived. Despite being a half vampire, Blade is not immortal. Arriving at the hospital, Blade discovers that he's too late, when the badly charred vampire has attacked a Nurse. Blade saves her, but discovers that she is slowly turning into a vampire herself & unless she can find a cure for herself in a couple of days, she will wind up joining the undead!. Fun action packed film, is one no horror or action fan should ignore. A fun ride throughout. Followed by a sequel, BLADE 2 **** (stars)"
31221,"not the Electra I know...; Perhaps I'm out of date or just don't know what Electra is like in current publications... But the Electra that I read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. She usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved. Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way. This movie was fairly weak on the dialog, the acting wasn't particularly convincing, and the action was spotty. I was really looking for something more along the lines of Frank Miller's book ""Electra Assassin."" Which is much darker than anything in this movie. Special effect where cool, action was interesting at times, but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical. Tha Hand was not menacing enough, and Electra was not..... bitchy enough. She's the girl you love to hate... but in this story, I just didn't care either way."
8972,"Disappointment; I guess I shouldn't be surprised - This is a Hollywood production, after all. The incredibly bad dialog, the childish ""codes"" (which weren't codes, they were ciphers), the scrambled facts... Well, I guess I am just not a part of the target audience. This is ""The DaVinci Code"", with a REALLY bad script and a disregard for history and fact which actually surpasses said book. The movie was, all in all, not even a decent adventure movie. The symbology was scrambled, the facts were scrambled - the only reason to give it anything but the weakest grade is that it's vaguely amusing to hear the nonsense and be able to comment on it... Even Nicholas Cage wasn't able to save this one. Good riddance. Go read the DaVinci Code, or even better, something with actual facts in it - and perhaps a plausible story."
8977,"good god.; This movie was so bad it was good. It is filled with the usual homosexual, incest overtones and violence of any good romantic ancient war film. It was a bit like watching a bunch of episodes of a T.V. program--- strung together by Sir Anthony's monologue--- The only reason this film was watchable was the long dialog scenes and Colin Farrel's scenes with his mother (Angelina Jolie) creepy and hot at the same time. It also has one of the best love 'fights' including slapping and knives---- I won't spoil it--- If you must see this film then see it--- if not then wait until you have the courage to face a long epic. ...and I won't get into the modern propaganda aspects of the film... I also liked the beginning of the film--- which I thought was about the founding of the early Irish empire--- until I saw all the deserts---"
3892,"Well-made, but not for the weak of stomach; There's more than passing resemblance here to the Spanish film Tesis from a few years before. Same basic set up, same relationship of heroine to other characters. This film just ups the gross-out ante of that snuff-films-on-campus opus several times over. The palpable threat hanging over everyone in the film, throughout, is that they will be drugged, strapped to a stainless steel table and wake up as the subject of a vivisection in progress. I have to hand it to the makers of Anatomie: I have a hard time imagining anything much worse than that. Given this extremely unpleasant premise, you never really rest easy at any point during the film. Not once. There isn't much blood here; the grisly stuff is dry as a bowl of rice-o-roni for the most part. But blood might actually be a relief from all the taxidermy. I felt my gorge rise a couple of times during this flick, as I never did during the Texas Chainsaw remake, as hard as that film tried. Anatomie succeeds brilliantly, over all, as what experts call a really icky experience. I give it an 8 because it is, even if extremely unpleasant, also very well made. It scares and disturbs, and the suspense is very taut. It's good at doing the things that make you watch it to begin with. --The total revulsion the film engenders is just a fringe benefit, or a problem to be overlooked, depending on how strong your stomach is."
80903,"Leapin Lizards; A group of mountain travelers find refuge in a cave where professor Conrad Nagel is examining prehistoric wall drawings. Nagel soon goes into a lengthy examination of the meaning of these pictures for his newly arrived guests which turns into the flashback which is the film. The pictures are the story of two prehistoric peoples: the tribal, brute rock people and the pleasant, peaceful shell people. Naturally, the story is a romance between stars Victor Mature(just his second feature film) and the lovely blonde Carole Landis. This film, produced by Hal Roach, has some things going for it. I liked the division between the two tribes and how each sustained life in a prehistoric world. The acting was surprisingly good with Mature and Landis doing credible jobs despite spouting occasional gibberish meant to be taken as caveman lingo. Landis in fact is quite affable and charming(being in a mini-cave dress always helps too). Lon Chaney Jr. gets his start in this type of film so to speak as the head of the rock people and as Mature's father. Chaney is good and is able to emote lots of emotion while using little dialog. The special effects are unfortunately not too special as we are basically given Irwin Allen/Bert I Gordon dinosaurs. You know the type. Iguanas and other common lizards, as well as an alligator, dressed up in fins and the like. For the technology used, these effects are okay and predate my examples of movies using them. There are also some very non-scientific bits of information used throughout the film...like man has already got domesticated dogs for just one example. Overall, this movie is a pleasant fantasy of what life might have been back then. It should not be taken too seriously as it is in truth a fairly simple tale with a simple message of how man might change through the influence of another(Landis on Mature and his people)."
3272,"The Cinema of Abel Ferrara; Bad Lieutenant (1992) has to be one of Abel Ferrara's most misunderstood film. The movie's filled with Catholic guilt and religious dogma. It's about a corrupt soul seeking a way to find redemption and to enter the after world with a clear conscience. Made for nearly next to nothing, Abel Ferrara and Harvey Keitel make one of the most moving films ever made. Harvey Keitel stars as the title character. A corrupt police officer who dwells in his excesses. A man who has hit rock bottom and tries to go even further. But by chance, he comes across a Catholic Nun who was savagely raped by two former altar boys. This enrages the Bad L.T. who has more problems of his own to deal with. After meeting with the Nun, she forgives them because it's what she's been taught and what she believes in her heart. After hearing the Nun's response , it drives the Bad L.T. crazy because he believes that they should get just punishment but she refuses. The meeting with the Nun stirs deep hidden religious feelings that are still within the Bad L.T. After having a deep experience with the Almighty and his son, the Bad L.T. tries to do the right thing so he can find salvation for his soul. All the while his little world that he created collapses from his past sins and vices. Abel Ferrara directs a film that he knows how to do. A gritty street level cinematic experience. There are no expensive set pieces or flashy wardrobes or special effects. It's as if Abel Ferrara is taking you on a guided trip through the deeps of a corrupt person who has a flicker of a conscience deep inside. Be forewarned because it is a rough ride and only for those who can stomach the material. The song at the end will stick around in your head for awhile. A fitting end to a great movie such as this. Highly Recommended. If you're a Catholic you'll understand the dogma more than those who are unfamiliar with the Church's teachings. They're a big part of the movie and a lot of people wont understand the motivation that drives the Bad L.T."
31221,"Great action film!; ELEKTRA (2005) cast: Jennifer Garner, Goran Visnjic, Kirten Prout, Will Yun Lee, Terence Stamp, Natassia Malthe, Bob Sapp, Chris Ackerman, Edson T. Ribeiro, Colin Cunningham. plot: Years ago, Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) fought to the death in a battle against the man who murdered her father. But then, she was mystically resurrected by blind warrior Stick (Terence Stamp). She now works as an assassin. When she is assigned to kill Mark Miller (Goran Vinsjic) and his powerful teenage daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout), she ends up teaming up with them in order to protect them from the powerful Order of The Hand, a team of ninja assassins with individual powers. the good: After watching both the theatrical cut and director's cut of DAREDEVIL, I noticed that Elektra needed a spin off because she didn't have enough screen time and we knew she was going to be resurrected because of the comics. Now, I do believe that this is far superior to the film DAREDEVIL and explores the character Elektra much more, in a deeper way. In DD she was a strong woman but didn't fully understand her strength or her destiny, she also was very vulnerable. In this, she wears red because she is not afraid to be seen, she is now stronger, she has suppressed a lot of compassion and emotion when it comes to her job and even has the ability to see a little of what is about to happen. Elektra is a great character. Abby Miller (Kirsten Prout) was a lot like Elektra in DD only ten years younger. That makes her a great character because Elektra knows just how to help her. The villains are also awesome. Kirgi (Will Yun Lee) had great presence and was a great fighter, Natassia Malthe's character (forgot her name) was very menacing and sexy, and very beautiful, Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) had awesome powers. the bad: Mark Miller. He was an OK guy but his almost love story with Elektra was just pointless. They had zero chemistry, besides I thought she would still be in love with Matt. ***"

5254,"I loved this sequel!; BLADE 2 is a rare accomplishment, it's a sequel that equals, maybe even surpasses it's fun, action packed original. The plot this time around has the neck nibblers the victims, coming under attack by a strain of mutant Nosferatu looking vampires, whom hate other breeds of vampires & man alike, creatures whom multiply like crazy & within a year, could turn the whole world into their breed, terminating man's rein on earth. The vampires only hope, is to enlist the help of the one man they hate & whom hates them even more, BLADE. But despite the fact that he's helping the vampires, he is also unaware of more sinister forces at work in the old breed that has hired him, that may have something to do with this new breed being made. WESLY SNIPES returns in the role he created in the original & does extremely well in the role. The film is filled with more action from beginning to end, not to mention more gore & the special effects are outstanding. The ending also offers a few surprises that I never saw coming. A must see for fans of the original Followed by a sequel, BLADE: TRINITY **** (stars)"
6881,"Be patient with this...it's well worth the time!; *** possible spoilers ahead *** When I first started watching this film, I thought, ""Here we go again, the loser of the family is trying to win the family stamp of approval (which isn't gonna happen) and we're going to struggle along with her character's failed attempts."" But then something changed... On the surface, this is all you may notice and that would make it a lame movie. However, as the story unfolds, April's desperate attempt to please her family goes way deeper than meets the eye. Put yourself in April's shoes and you'd throw in the towel by mid-morning. The final resolution ends the film on such a perfect note that it made the slow beginning worth the time. It's like a cracking whip that makes no sound and then CRAAACK!!! out of nothing. Patricia Clarkson is perfect as the mother and the family dynamic is just awesome. They're no different from any of our families and I think that's what makes it work. Well worth it! 9/10"
426,"The Cinema of Abel Ferrara.; Body Snatchers (1993) was another one of Abel Ferrara's mainstream films. After Bad Lieutenant (1992) and Dangerous Game (1993), he moved on to this film for some unknown reason. maybe the chance to work on a big budgeted film was the draw. The story takes place in a military base. A young army brat learns about witnesses first hand the presence of some alien invaders who want to take over the Earth and populate it with their own. Can the young lady and her boyfriend save the planet from doom? If you have seen the first two films then you know the story. Abel Ferrara makes this film even darker than the other two. He leaves his mark all over the place. The cinematography is excellent and is filled with moody earth tones and shadows. If you're a fan of the first two films or an Abel Ferrara fan then I would highly recommend this movie. Others need not apply."
1283,"unrealistic; Fairy tale westerns like High Noon and Shane never captured my imagination (or attention) like the grittier ""Searchers"" and ""Rio Bravo"" or more recently ""Outlaw Josey Wales"" and ""Unforgiven"". Even as a child these movies didn't ring true to me. They were simple movies for simple minds in a more simple time. I never bought into the premise that EVERYONE would abandon the sheriff. My view of the west was one of rugged individualism. People who settled the west were fighters and scrappers by nature.

8784,"Quirky and funny and a gorgeous soundtrack; Garden State is a very enjoyable movie. I'm glad I didn't read all of the reviews before seeing it, because I think the movie is more fun when it's surprises are left to the view to discover. Zach Braff does a good job with both acting and directing, and since he also wrote the script--he deserves the full credit for this creation. Natalie Portman is terrific as the love interest. This is the first time I've seen her in a movie where I found her appealing. The supporting cast is excellent. Jean Smart is particularly good as a zonked out, but very loving mother. The soundtrack is sumptuous, and adds greatly to the movie."
26383,"Now We Know Why Computers Have Hard Drives; Dean Koontz's novel about a computer wanting to keep its legacy alive by basically having a woman impregnated with his essentials if you will has some merit and a lot of fault. Director Cammil does a real good job of keeping the suspense going throughout the first three-quarters of the film. The ridiculous plot and how it is executed almost seems plausible during this time. Much of that is directly due to Cammil's subtle direction and the acting of leads Fritz Weaver, and in particular, Julie Christie. Christie is the central character in most of the film as a woman that has been locked in a specially high-tech house by a computer called Proteus(voice done very nicely by Robert Vaughn). It seems Proteus doesn't want to perform the tasks he has been asked to do and wants to have a child with Christie. Well, I was able to not dwell too much on the scientific un-reality of such a plot strand because of the acting, atmosphere, and some very well-crafted scenes, but things just got out of hand in credibility in the last quarter of the film. Without going into too much detail, the actualization of the plot's climax and the necessary downfall of viewer credibility is just too powerful a force at the films climatic end. I was laughing and shaking my head from side to side with disbelief that so incompetent an ending would actually be thought to work by all parties involved. Anyway, Demon Seed is interesting, quirky, and something fresh at least for me. While definitely leaps and bounds away from being a good film, it is not a bad film either. I found it to be quite entertaining for the most part and at least one more condemnation on the success and rate of success our world has with creating and trusting too much in technological advances and artificial intelligence."
6902,"Never-heard-of Gem could do without raunch; When I came across this movie at the video store, I had never heard of it, despite some of the names associated with it (I think the Back to the Future creator wrote it or something). Well, I rented it on a gamble that paid off for me, but it may not be for everybody. It's a quirky film with an overall feel much like the more recent 'Big Fish' -- complete with a cast of oddball characters and bizarre situations. It's an enjoyable viewing and has some very funny scenes. My only major complaint about this film is that it has some raunchy language that completely takes away from its charm. Casting Michael J. Fox as a ranting, swearing cell phone toting lunatic is a welcome change of character, but it would have been way more effective without the language. Now, I could care less about abusive language, but it really hurts the film in that it loses a large part of the audience that probably would have appreciated it the most. It's a good film, but it could have been much better. After all, Marty McFly never swore his head off. 8/10"
6370,"ERASMUS - here we go!; I think that this film is a masterpiece! I'm from Germany and went abroad on the European student exchange program ""Erasmus"" myself even before that film was shot. So I can tell everyone that this film shows perfectly what such a trip abroad is like: a lot of red-tape before you can go, problems like finding a flat and understanding people once you're there but also the melting pot of Erasmus students from all European countries, coming together and communicating by all means as if nationality didn't count anymore! It's about all that and the film depicts the ""Erasmus atmosphere"" in a beautiful way. So, dear North Americans: If you want to get an idea about European student life, watch this movie! Two thumbs up!"
46372,"Laughton Steals Film; This was quite an enjoyable film experience. Robert Taylor plays a federal agent flying down South to look into a smuggling problem. Whilst in the tropical Carlita, Taylor begins to look into the suspects he has been briefed about: a married couple that work at a night club. Sultry seductress Ava Gardner and husband John Hodiak play the couple. Director Robert Z. Leonard does a fine job with atmosphere in this film noir classic of greed, retribution, and forbidden love. The settings reek with a kind of sleazy realism that you rarely see in films of this type. Leonard also shoots his scenes with an intensity and trust in his performers which is also refreshing. And why wouldn't he trust his performers? He has some of the best. Taylor gives the best performance I ever saw come out of him. He is actually believable in his role as a man torn with a love he should not have and a decision to make regarding his personal integrity. Gardner is also at her best giving a truly interesting portrayal as a woman also torn apart by like things. But the film really belongs to two ""character"" actors if you will. Screen legends Charles Laughton and Vincent Price, playing men with dubious natures, give great performances and bring this film up notches. Price is the real heavy and oozes suave, despicable charm. His climatic scene is one of the best film finales of all-time for my money. It is Charles Laughton; however, as a round bounder of sorts tressed in a grubby white suit with unkempt hair seeming to be always around when you don't want him that really steals the show. Laughton gives one of those performances that makes you glued to his every word and action. He utters his lines with careful execution and deliberate pauses. He takes the mundane and turns it into something more like every time he sits down to take his shoes off and rub his bad feet. Many highlights come to mind with this film: the aforementioned finale, Laughton rolling languidly through his scenes chewing whatever scenery is available, Laughton and Price sharing some scenes together(great to see these two in the same scene), Ava Gardner dancing, and just above-average camera work and crisp dialog in that great film noir tradition. A classic!"
8981,"Closer - pretty good.; It's OK. Enjoyable. Engaging. It's not has great as awards shows would have you believe. The performances aren't bad. All the actors do the job. But ""theatre"" dialogue and scenes of non-action make ""great performances"" impossible. It would be good if there were films being made about adult relationships. There probably aren't any. The ""High Concept"" infantilism of post Lucas/Spielberg, among other things, means film is no longer used for pure drama. CLOSER may inspire someone to make a better film on the same theme. Some people may find these characters spoilt and dull and the story pretentious, but some people will love this film. For some people this will be ""film of the year"". It's a bit artsy. Check it out. But don't expect too much."
31410,"Awesome psychological analysis of Hitler and his generals /  close women; Very good movie. I saw a lot of movies of 2nd WW, and this is one of the greatest, although there are nearly no scenes of combat. It provides you a very good insight of what can be the last month of a war in a Headquarter (95% of the movie is inside a bunker). The movie is very psychological, you never are bored, although everybody knows how it finishes. I was much impressed by the actor that plays Hitler, showing this person as a bit ""schizophrenic"": he changes his mind from despair to great hope although most generals know how it will finish. You really feel yourself as one of the generals and thinking ""What should I say to this crazy Hitler now ? If I tell the truth he will become mad and if I lie saying everything goes alright, I and my family will be killed"" You see also the complete fanatic Nazis and SS that take Hitler like their god (Goebbels, his wife, the SS officers...) You feel the cruelty and absence of mercy of Hitler, although he sometimes shows some humanity and gentleness to women and to the fidel generals. ""If I die, all Germans deserve to die too"" - ""all the strong Aryans are dead in combat, so all the weak (remaining civilians in Berlin) should die too"" The play of the actresses (Eva Braun, the secretary, the wife of Goebbels) is impressive too. Brrrrrr, what a terrible guy Hitler (and the SS) were. Did you know that all future SS soldiers received a dog for their 14 year old and had to kill the dog when they were 16 ! After that, you understand what kind of inhumane beings you can create with some machiavelic methods on young people."
30707,"Boxing Clever; This movie has just opened in England and if a better one opens before the end of 2005 (and I say this with A Very Long Engagement waiting in the wings) then 2005 will take its place beside the vintage year of 1939. In the middle of the twentieth century three outstanding boxing movies were released, Champion, The Set-Up and Body and Soul, three movies, three heavyweights, Kirk Douglas, Robert Ryan, John Garfield, but Million Dollar Baby is better than all three put together - and, please, don't write in and say what about Raging Bull; I could put on 30 lbs but does that make me an actor? A REAL actor can ACT heavy, so enough with overrated deNiro already. If anybody told me I'd be moved to tears by a Clint Eastwood movie I would have thought they were barking but here I am with a soaking handkerchief and a slightly punch-drunk expression. As I write this the news is just in that Swank and Eastwood have just picked up Best Actress and Best Director Golden Globes and that's what I call justice. If Imelda Staunton's over-hyped Vera Drake had eased out Swank it would have been the greatest travesty since Mick Jagger got a gong from the Queen. Other posters here have already covered the plot so all I can add is GREAT! GREAT! GREAT! 10/10"
26099,"honeymoon from hell; Plot:A newly married couple the Harcourts (Edward de Souza and Jennifer Daniel) while on honeymoon somewhere in eastern Europe run into a bit of car trouble just outside a village which is run by the Ravna vampire family.After booking into the village hotel they get an invitation to the Vampire castle for a masked ball,during which Mrs Harcourt disappears,of course the vampires tell Harcourt that there never was a wife and that he came alone..Mrs Harcourt has been ravished by the leader of the family Dr Ravna(Noel Willman).Harcourt who has been sent on his way from the Ravna castle, seeks help from the mysterious Professor Zimmer(Clifford Evans) to try and get his wife back. Review: Being a big Hammer Horror fan I was looking forward to this film,having read some good reviewsthere are none of the regular stars here and so this is an unusual film in the Hammer cataloguethe vampires can go out in the daylight and they don't appear to have any of the powers one would expect of a family of vampiresthey are more like a religious sect than vampires as they wear white robes a lot of the timevery strange.The sets are great particularly the castle....The masked ball sequence is done very well and is very reminiscent of the masked ball scenes in Eyes Wide Shut even down to the stark and haunting piano soundtrack,I wonder if Stan the man was influenced in any way by this scenehmmm...I feel the film suffers from the very stiff acting of some of the stars,and a rather dull scriptDon Sharp's direction is also a little incoherent.I cant help feeling this would have been a much better film in Terence Fisher's hands and a more familiar cast perhaps Peter Cushing in the VanHelsing like role of Professor Zimmer.The grand finale is well worth waiting for though 7/10"
8368,"Some good performances, but bad replacements. The better Potter movie to date.; After finding that the second movie was much better then the first and then seeing the trailers for the third, I was really under the impression that the third would outshine the first two. The comments were that it was much darker and adult, and that was backed up by the trailer. Oh sure it was better than the Philosophers Stone, but better than Chamber of Secrets? Surely, with the more adult storyline and the darker mood, surely it was better. The Director had even been changed, and that could make it go either way. Well I wasn't so much disappointed as not excited enough. Yes, it was darker and much more for an adult audiences taste with an extremely clever plot, but there were still some problems with it all. Firstly, the eighty minutes of scene setting and build up, in that time we hardly see anything that's really concerned with the final part of the movie. Just the usual character settings and plot explanations. Then there are the standard plot deviations to explain something new about the Potter universe, and once complete we pop back into the story. This is fine, but in this movie I felt there was too much of that. Yet again, as with the other two films, there is the ending and the many unanswered questions. For example, why doesn't Professor Snipes say anything about Harry blasting him, what happens to the Dementors and why were they after Harry in the first place on the train? There are lots of these and mostly popping up nearer the end of the movie. There's also one of the major plot twists just happening with the wet fanfare of a single trumpeter. In fact the turn happens so quickly and without notice you do suddenly wonder why and what the hell just went on. Unfortunately, I do think Michael Gambon is a great actor, but not as Dumbledore, not as a replacement for the late Richard Harris. His acting and mannerisms are totally wrong for the part and present more of a bungling old man rather than the wise and all knowing character that Harris portrayed. Still, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson are very good in their roles. Also the effects were excellent in this movie, in particular the Dementors, the Hypocrate creature and once again the spider! The story overall is much more enjoyable and more representative of a movie plot line than the other two. The darkness and maturity also provide for a much stronger and watchable movie, however the shortcomings are still too much for me to overlook and really be taken into the film and the world of Harry Potter. I think it will now become very interesting as to how the stories progress with such obviously ageing actors in the lead roles and a new Director for the next movie and a new Screenwriter onboard after that. For me, I would like these changes to be for the better, although sticking with Alfonso Cuarón for another movie might have been a wise move. We can but wait and see. As for the DVD, the same issues are in this DVD as before, the extras are difficult to get to and you never really know what each menu option is for. However, it does have a very cool style to the navigation, but still no audio commentary!"
6596,"a bunch of upper crust crumbs; Another Merchant Ivory production, sumptuously photographed in a great location, restrained (with the occasional outburst)& centered on the mores of the upper classes, both American & French. Perhaps the filmmakers were trying show that money influences how families behave. Unfortunately in this film these behaviors are presented as ""stereotypical"" for each culture, which was very irritating. Other quibbles include; the impression given that every French family owns a country seat; the son of the family appears to be based superficially on Kevin Klein in ""French Kiss""!; French women are cold and calculating. A divorce is a difficult process in nearly every country, not just in France. As for different customs, the French family strongly resembles some wealthy USA families I know! Perhaps that is why many viewers thought it boring!"
8951,"Projects a love for humanity; Set in working class London in the 1950s long before abortion was legalized, Mike Leigh's Vera Drake is about a middle-aged wife and mother of two who performs abortions on young women without means only because she wants to help them out. Winner of the Golden Lion at the 61st Venice International Film Festival, Vera Drake is a powerful character study about a generous but naive woman who allowed her good deeds to be undermined by secrets and lies. Imelda Staunton is outstanding as Vera, projecting a love for humanity that is hard to resist. Vera lives in a modest London flat with her husband Stan (Phil Davis), a garage mechanic who works with his brother Frank (Adrian Scarborough), and her two adult children Sid (Daniel Mays), a tailor, and Ethel (Alex Kelly), a withdrawn factory worker. Pregnant women are directed to Vera through a mercenary friend Lily (Ruth Sheen) who requires payment for her services, but Vera does not ask for money and seems naively unaware of Lily's commercial ventures. She works in secret, dispatching her troubled women with the same cheery efficiency that she shows when fixing a tasty dinner for her family. Employing a procedure that has worked effectively for centuries, Vera uses only lye, a pump and syringe, and boiled water to perform the abortion. She stays with the young women only long enough to offer them tea and sympathy, explaining that soon they will feel a pain down below, and if they get themselves to the toilet, with a little bleeding, everything will ""come away"". Though the film is primarily a social drama, political points are scored when Vera's home remedies are contrasted with the professional medical procedures that only the wealthy can afford. The family is close-knit and very supporting and when Ethel announces that she is engaged to neighbor Reg (Eddie Marsan), it seems as if their happiness is boundless. Yet, when one of Vera's patients ends up in the hospital in serious condition, a police investigation is triggered and Vera is arrested on a felony charge on the same day the family is celebrating daughter Ethel's engagement. Her personality undergoes a heartbreaking change and the once loquacious woman is left mumbling incoherently, unable to mount a defense of her actions. At the end, I was left with anger at an inhumane system interested only in setting an example, a profound sadness for Vera and for the betrayal felt by her family, and a renewed experience of love for the people around me."
7941,"Bravo Bergman; Men, as a gender, do not come off well in Bergman's charming sex comedy Smiles of a Summer Night, made only one year before his breakthrough hit, The Seventh Seal. At the center of the film is Frederik Egerman (Gunnar Bjonstrand) pompous and self-assured as a lawyer but insecure and frightened by competition as a lover. His son, Henrik (Bjorn Bjelvenstam), torn between the church and the bedroom, is filled with self-hatred for even thinking about going to bed with Petra the maid (Harriet Andersson). Another over-the-top male character is Count Malcolm (Jarl Kulle) a poseur whose only response to his wife's infidelity is to challenge the paramour to a duel or a game of Russian Roulette. In Bergman's world, men are childish, selfish, and arrogant. The women on the other hand are stronger, more self-reflective, capable of pandering to the male ego and to direct their affections elsewhere when the need arises. They suffer greatly, however. Charlotte Malcolm(Margit Carlqvist), the Count's wife admits that she hates men and finds them repulsive with their ""hairy"" bodies but nonetheless is hopelessly in love with her philandering husband. She says that in any event ""a woman's view is seldom based on aesthetics. And one can always turn out the light."" Set at the turn of the century, Frederik is married to the very beautiful 19-year old Anne (Ulla Jacobson) but their marriage has never been consummated even after the passage of two years. Though it remains unclear as to why this is the case, nonetheless, Frederik is not at a loss for romance, taking up with a famous actress the equally lovely Desiree Armfeldt (Eva Dahlbeck), a relationship that began soon after Frederik's first wife died but never revealed to Anne. He confides in her in a way that he cannot with his young wife and she is a comfort to him though their relationship is full of bitter verbal thrusts and parries. Desiree on the other hand has a string of lovers and it is not hard to understand why, given her fame, beauty, and rapier wit. One of them is the aforementioned Count Malcolm, a ludicrous character with his military getup and macho posturing. The Count is also not averse to playing around and it turns out that he is also married to the stately and elegant Charlotte. He says that he can accept someone making overtures to his wife but if anyone goes after his mistress, he becomes a ""tiger"". Later he says the exact opposite when his wife and Frederik have a go round. Oh yes, Henrik secretly desires Anne, and Petra, well she's open to any offers. The situation could have deteriorated into farce but in Bergman's assured hand, everything is resolved in a civilized and even graceful way at a gathering of all eight combatants at Anne's mother's country retreat. Here they all drink a mystery wine and sort out their relationships in a remarkably satisfying manner. Smiles of a Summer Night came as quite a surprise to me, being used to the philosophical Bergman of Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal (yet always with an added bit of humor). I found it thoroughly enjoyable, an opinion apparently shared with Woody Allen whose film A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy mirrored it and Stephen Sondheim who based his musical ""A Little Night Music"" on the film. I can't remember when there was such a collection of beautiful women in one film. Not only do they look wonderful but act impeccably and say wise and witty things. Bravo Bergman!"
8917,"I laughed my ass off.; If you're the kind of person who calls swearing 'curse words' then this movie is something you should avoid at all costs. All normal, non-fundamentalists however, will probably end up crying with laughter. The film, as you are no doubt now aware, is Trey Parkers satire on the heavy-handed foreign policy of the United States and it's current global effect. The US is portrayed as the centre of the universe, Americans are keen but trigger-happy police and the middle eastern people among us are terrorists toting weapons of mass destruction On several occasions they charge in with there high-tech, red white and blue vehicles and blow the bejeezus out of several historic locations as they try to blast the terrorists off the face of the planet. Locals are left stunned and bruised amongst the rubble of their once beautiful cities as the Team cheerful mount up and head back for America, knowing they've saved the locals yet again, completely ignorant of the devastation they've just visited upon them. I am a fan of Thunderbirds, a fan of South Park and a lover of bad movies and pastiches of bad movies, so this was right up my particular alley. The puppetry was pure Thunderbirds, and on several occasions the limitations of the marionettes are used as material for laughs rather than trying to disguise it. The entire sex scene had the audience in fits, with no attempt made to disguise the joints and obvious construction of the 'actors'. There's so much in this movie I cant begin to sum it up, I can only recommend that you go see it yourself if you haven't already. It had swearing, sex, outrageous violence, vomiting, action, cool vehicles, excellent locations and lots of intelligent humour."
7361,"Terribly bad film; This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It starts off great with the main character (Jim Carrey) meeting a mysterious girl (Kate Winslet) on a beach. They then go to her house for her to pick up her toothbrush. During this part the lighting is nice, the characters look interesting and the whole atmosphere is pleasant. The film starts going wrong after that. OK so the story is that in fact the 2 characters knew each other before that scene (they were dating) but had fallen out and had voluntarily gone through a (very far-fetched) memory erasing program (so as to forget about each other). So that scene is the first where they meet after having forgotten about each other (we only find that out much later) and they fall in love again. As you can see the full plot holds in about 4 lines. Not enough for a 2 hour long film might you think. How right you are! What makes the film even worse is that in order to try to hide this evident lack of story the director has tried to tell it (the story) in a ""clever"" way by filming the main character's (Jim Carrey's) thoughts and memories. The result is a huge boring mess. In some ways the complicated narrative made me think of Pulp Fiction in the way that it mixes past and present and that you can only really put it all together at the end. The main difference being that in Pulp Fiction there were about 10000 ideas (storywise) while here there is only 1. And this 1 idea just drags on and on and on during the whole film. Negative aspects of the film: Lack of any interesting story (already mentioned previously). The darkness of the pictures, apart from the first scene all the film is very very dark (mostly because it's supposed to be taking place at night). This makes the film very sad and depressing, it feels like a bad dream. Lack of any humor, the film could have been made better by a few jokes but there are hardly any amusing scenes. Jim Carrey playing a kid, the scenes where Jim Carrey plays himself as a boy just look ridiculous. They don't work. Although these scenes might have looked OK on paper they don't work in the film. Positive aspects of the film: The actors are good (especially Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey), but is it really positive to think that their talent has been wasted in such a bad film?"
7371,"A film for Europeans that love to hate America; This has two partsthe first half is creative and intriguing. The second half is ridiculous and cliché. The movie is about 1.5 hours too long. It is a view of America from the eyes of a Dane (the Writer/Director). It has nothing to do with Americaonly clichés of Americaright down to the mob and America's sexually repressed citizens. The movie made only $1.5 million in the U.S. and 5 times that amount in the U.S. bashing continent of Europe. It won every European film award and wasn't nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe. This is a hateful, Euro-trash look at America. The concept was exciting and original. The story deteriorated into the usual sexually deviant, violence loving European monologue on America. While in realitythe America portrayed in this movie only exists in the minds of a culture that loves to hate America."
5779,"Throw Physic to the Fish!; You know a film is going to be less than stellar when it opens with a red tint flashing over blue tinted scenes in the opening credits and then shows a love-making session in the deep blue where we hear a noise and then see the naked woman and man die in a fish feeding frenzy. We do not see fish at this point nor much else really. How can a man and woman take off their oxygen masks and kiss passionately fathoms below? Oh, never mind, it is just one more anomaly this film is filled with. In a nutshell, the film details how a club resort is affected by what we learn were several cans of fish eggs left in a ship off the nearby coast. It seems these eggs were mutant piranha eggs. Eggs of fish that can emerge from larval stages into full-finned piranha now able to exist and thrive in saltwater. Not only that, but these fish have wings and can fly out of water and live hours(the fish in the cadaver for instance)on dry land. Yeah. Why did the fish have to live in the ship? Was it the only place in the ocean that was dark Why didn't the fish leave the area and move elsewhere? Why didn't the fish breed? This film has little sense of reality nor creativity nor competence in execution. It could have been better to be sure, if the director(or directors as it seems) used more care in transitions, editing, and credibility concerns. Once you see the fish - you feel like laughing because they are so ludicrous. James Cameron may not have full credit for this fiasco, but he along with Ovidio G. Assontis take joint blame for the film's failings. It is not all bad though by any means. I mean, sure, this is a turkey of a film. What did you really expect when you sat down to watch it. But this film is entertaining in some ways: there is a tongue firmly planted in cheek throughout the film, some decent acting from the likes of Steve Marachuk, Lance Henrikson, Ted Richert as a hotel manager, and Tricia O'Neil(also quite a good looking lady), some pretty girls dressed in nice bathing attire(or none at all), and some nice location shots. Don't expect too much from the plot. You surely will be disappointed then. This film also is miles away from its original directed with flair and obvious tongue in cheek humour by Joe Dante."
3537,"Where is the money; I saw the first half of this movie and I almost fell asleep... Boring! The only good part in it was when Paul Newman was on screen. The story couldn't interest me unfortunately and maybe it was because of Miss Fiorentino: no charisma at all and really annoying. But hey, who am I? So I didn't (couldn't, actually) finish seeing this movie. Still, I found it too bad because Mr Newman has always been a favorite and I enjoyed most of the movies he's been in. I guess if the storyline doesn't 'grab' me it's just wasting time. Dermot Mulroney however has a great body! LOL! No but seriously, I thought his and Mr Newman's performance were good. All in all not my favorite Paul Newman movie. My husband thought it was a nice movie, so no comparing in taste is there? If you want to see a movie that isn't that complicated or exciting, thrilling etc. okay then it's a 'must see'. But don't blame me if you missed it because of falling asleep during watching it..."
1215,One of the best movies ever; This movie has it all. its very different from the first 2 evil dead movies but don't let this fool you. Ash is funny as hell and this is probably Bruce Campell best part ever. Not everyone will enjoy it though. Its kinda like the 3 Evil Dead movies have evolved from horror to comedy u can already see this a bit in part 2. Anyway its Raimi's best movie by far. I also heard there is going to be a remake of Evil Dead without Bruce Cambell and I'm totally against this idea why would Raimi want to remake it after it was already perfect and why no more Bruce Cambell? Anyway every1 should have seen this movie because its the best movie out their in its genre
8984,"Twelve is the new Eleven; Who needs twelve drummers drumming when you've got twelve con artists and thieves vying for ways to steal $190 million in two weeks? Why $190 million? That's the amount stolen from Las Vegas casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) in Ocean's Elevenand he wants his money backwith interest! Set three years after the end of the Eleven escapades, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) reassembles his eleven con artists and thieves, adding one new team member, to appease an angry Benedict who only gives the team two weeks to return all of the cash. Meanwhile, Ocean's Twelve tries to avoid confrontations with an inexplicable French rival called the ""Night Fox"" and dodge Europol agent Isabel Lehiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones). All bets are off. Directed by Steven Soderbergh proves something. With eleven announced production jobs currently, Soderbergh has it in for himself. Not only did he direct Ocean's Eleven, but he has also directed other magnificent films such as Traffic, Erin Brockovich, and The Limey. One large incentive to seeing Ocean's Twelve is the acting. This movie definitely screams big names. Co-stars George Clooney (Intolerable Cruelty, O Brother, Where Art Thou?) and Brad Pitt (Troy, Meet Joe Black) really complement each other. Other stars of Ocean's Twelve include Matt Damon (The Bourne Identity), Catherine Zeta-Jones (The Terminal), Andy Garcia (Night Falls On Manhattan), and Julia Roberts (Closer). The difference between this original and its sequel is the dialogue. When watching Ocean's Eleven, one is on the edge of the seat, but in Ocean's Twelve one finds himself laughing more. The excess humor in the sequel gives it a different taste than the original. The cinematography in this film is definitely accentuated by the variety. The many different camera angles and transitions in this motion picture truly amazed me. The storyline adds its spice, allowing this movie to shine. Musically, the mood was well conveyed through the music. There were times when I could notice the disposition being expressed by simple music. As an apparent success, Ocean's Twelve was number one at the Box-Office its first weekend. Competing with Blade: Trinity, which came out Wednesday December 8, wasn't a hard task. Ocean's Twelve took in $39.2 million right away, leaving Blade: Trinity to $24.5 million gross and National Treasure to third place in the dust. With a mild PG-13 rating for brief language, the film is peppered with language but doesn't take over the movie. Overall, Ocean's Twelve was to my liking. Without a seat available in the theater, the success of this movie was outstanding. I'm glad that Clooney was more appealing than Wesley Snipes, otherwise, I'd be frightened with the world I'm living in."
3739,"better than anything you see today; ""Trouble in Paradise"" is not only an enjoyable comedy, it is a beautiful experience that everyone deserves to enjoy. This film has something in it for everyone. I heard more laughs at a screening of this movie than any other movie in my life, and it deserves every single one. The ending is absolutely perfect. If it seems dated, that's what makes it so good! The comic timing is perfect, and the music, unlike most films of the era, is not too overbearing and goes along very well with every punchline. Like I said before, all of these elements together make this film an experience, and I wished it would go on longer! All the sexual innuendos keep you intrigued by not making everything blatantly obvious. That's the problem with most comedies; writers have any respect for the audience like the ones of this movie. They don't have to spell everything out to keep our interest. That's exactly why this movie works: you are surprised by several points because the dialogue still makes you think about the previous scene (We have to THINK to watch a movie, what a concept). Nothing gets better than this. All in all, no one should be without this masterpiece."
30816,"Its beauty cancels out its flaws...; Because I've seen the stage production and love the music, I went to see this film with an extremely critical eye. It wasn't perfect, but it was an excellent effort. Here are some thoughts: GERARD BUTLER as THE PHANTOM turned out to be an excellent choice. His portrayal is both sympathetic and sinister--as the Phantom should be. Although his voice isn't as trained as men who have tackled this role on stage, I have to say that Gerard Butler's method of singing adds more sadness to the character than others I've heard before. I think it was a wise casting choice to choose someone who isn't extremely well-known for the role (I, like many, had heard the rumors for years that Antonio Banderas was going to play the Phantom.) Gerard Butler had the anonymity that the character needs. (Oh yes, and he's hot.) EMMY ROSSUM as CHRISTINE DAAE was a good choice. She seems, to me, the way Gaston Leroux pictured Christine when he wrote the book. Unlike Sarah Brightman, who is a diva trying to look innocent and fragile, Rossum's Christine is innocent and fragile. She's sings very well--although there were a couple of places where you could tell the music had been modified for her--and is lovely on screen. My only complaint is that oftentimes she capitalizes on her loveliness a little too much by not showing a range of facial expressions. As another reviewer wrote, ""She looks as though she's been injected with some heavy tranquilizers."" Unfortunately, I agree... MINNIE DRIVER as CARLOTTA the diva was a brave and, decidedly, great choice. She is hilarious, as she should be. Minnie Driver has a way of portraying ridiculous characters who are supposed to be serious but aren't that is very endearing. No, she doesn't do her own singing and yes, the lip synching is way off for her first number, but it almost adds to the silliness of the character. Kudos to Minnie for holding that 3 foot wig up on her head, too. This was a character where it was nice to see a familiar face and, if you want to hear Minnie do her own singing, stay through the ending credits and hear her rendition of ""Learn to be Lonely."" She does a great job. MIRANDA RICHARDSON as MADAME GIRY and SIMON CALLOW as MR. ANDRE were other roles where it was nice to see familiar faces. Simon Callow is always over the top and hilarious, as this role demands. I do agree with another reviewer about the age makeup on Miranda Richardson at the very beginning and end of the film. Considering that she is older than Raoul and his age makeup makes him look much older than her was careless, but insignificant. PATRICK Wilson as RAOUL is someone I almost forgot to mention because he is so forgettable. The role often gets bashed--even for stage productions--but their casting choice here was very sloppy. No memorable singing or acting came out Patrick Wilson's performance in my opinion. There were many times when his character was speaking lines that would've ordinarily been sung. I don't know if this is because the filmmakers knew they couldn't demand much from his voice or because they wanted to do something new and different for the film. Either way, it happens so often with the Raoul character that one can't help but think they were trying to spare him from singing. Overall, he comes across as a blond piece of cardboard. Some last comments are: 1. Visually, the movie was stupendous. The costumes and production design will surely get some nods and recognition during award season. I was most impressed with the scene when Christine goes to the cemetery. It had a misty, Gothic look that would've made Tim Burton proud. 2. Despite the flaws, Lloyd Webber's music is so wonderfully haunting that it acts as a thread that carries the film from beginning to end. 3. I wish that the filmmakers had done more with the Phantom's mask and when to show it or when to show the healthy side of the Phantom's face. I remember in Mel Gibson's MAN WITHOUT A FACE that it seemed like he was very strategic in which side of the face you saw depending on what the character was experiencing. It is more random in PHANTOM and I think that the filmmakers missed an opportunity to stick in some subtle symbolism. 4. A last cheer for GERARD BUTLER. That man really put his heart and soul into the role and it shows. I was even more impressed with his singing efforts after buying the soundtrack. I was also very impressed with the look the filmmakers created for the PHANTOM. The very dark hair is effective and Gerard Butler has these piercing eyes that are accompanied by a lot expression, even on the masked side. I was very impressed by his performance. He had some big shoes to fill and yet still managed to make the role fresh and his own. Great job! A WORD OF ADVICE...see the movie. Everyone is so split in their opinions that the best thing is just to see it and form your own. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Happy movie-watching!"
30816,"Truly Breathtaking; I was truly stunned when I heard the actors/actresses sing in this film- their voices are honestly god enough to be used in the west end musical, London. The actions and expressions o their faces during the film was exceptional. This movie made me wan to go and see a musical that I thought sounded dull and repetitive before hand. I would recommend anyone to go and see this film, as it is a truly breathtaking piece of art, and that is exactly what it is - ART! With the music, beautiful costumes and amazing dancers. If that doesn't sway then let the fact that an extremely good looking Gerard Butler be your reason to go and see this remarkable film, and then I promise you that that won't be the only reason why you go back a second time. A beautiful and inspirational film about a misunderstood person- 10/10!"
7439,"vigilante-style justice done right; If you like the old Clint Eastwood & Charles Bronson revenge movies then you'll like this film. Great pace and action that's gritty but extremely enjoyable. I can't say I knew anything about this Punisher character before seeing this film but I thoroughly enjoyed it none-the-less. The Punisher is a shining example of revenge and vigilante-style justice done right. It's also yet another comic book adaptation done properly. In fact, this may be the first time I wished we could give half-vaults, because it was just that good. In the compendium of comic movies, this falls just shy of the two X-Men movies, but it is right there with Spider-Man and easily surpasses Batman, Superman and The Hulk. The fact that it is an R-rated movie killed any possible chance of decent box-office numbers, but it was a necessary step to take, and the quality of the movie just makes up for it. Hopefully this was Thomas Jane's breakout role."
30894,"Thought Would Be More Suspenseful But Just Turned Out Dry.; I didn't think that White Noise delivered and lived up to the hype. This movie was hyped for quite awhile and it turned out not to be the movie I believed it was going to be. It had some level of spookiness but was just not enough to make it scary. Michael Keaton did give a convincing performance of someone who had just lost his wife and I have to admit, I enjoyed Chandra West's appearance as well. I did not get the 3 evil guys. Were they humans, evil spirits or what? Am I even supposed to know? I just assumed they were human and the fact that they had short term premonitions seemed too far-fetched to me. The ending implied that there would be a sequel. I'm not too sure I'd see it after seeing this one. I'd probably just wait for it to come out on DVD."
1835,"Making me cry; Well,when I first saw ''city of angels'' I was 21 years old.Yesterday I watched it again.When I first saw it in 1998,made me cry, and yesterday I cried again.During this time of 7 years I remember that I cried just once,.I mean this movie is touching my deepest feelings;I mean I have missed crying.City of Angels is making me know that I have emotions.Excellent story,maybe it isn't just a story,it is real. We come from different walks of life but we share a common bond and it's time to say that of all of you I have grown so very fond. So friends thanks for being there whenever I have needed you I know you're always there for me and you know I'm here for you. :)"
1204,"One of the Best; Definitely one of the best films ever made. The other films apart, this was the masterpiece for David Lean, Peter O'Toole and Omar Shariff. Even the small parts by greats like the immortal Claude Raines were perfectly done. Like other comments, this movie is best viewed (or perhaps mandatory's the word) in a big screen theatre. To outsiders the movie can be deemed as long, sprawling and slow-moving, but it's truly wonderous in its scope with A++ acting from an A+ acting ensemble and the locations were second to none, but that's what one would expect from a David Lean production. Women might not like it as there were no speaking parts for them, but tell me where would even one line fit for a woman? A must see and one of the essentials in movie history."
127865,"so bad it's hilarious; there is only way to describe this movie. so bad its hilarious. the acting is so bad i laughed my ass off throughout. The male lead in this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous you would think he was trying to copy a toy action figure, i know this sounds ridiculous but when you see it for yourself you can't help but agree. the monster looks like a cgi guy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in old Sinbad movies. in short this movie is good for only one thing a really large laugh at how bad movies can get. If you want to see bad acting bad script and special effects gone wrong THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU"
1347,"A scary, cleverly written horror thriller!; Even after all these years A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET remains one of the most clever & very scary horror films ever made! WES CRAVEN has truly created one of the most terrifying villains of all time! A constantly giggling weirdo/maniac, that mostly keeps himself confined to the darkest areas of a persons dream, thus making him look more like a moving shadow before he springs on his intended victim. The film cleverly plays it's themes on everyones childhood fears of falling asleep & never waking up, The nightmare sequences are very realistic looking & plays all the things that can & does happen in nightmares to a hilt, dark shadows, dead people visiting the living while still in bloody bags, a monster emerging from under bed sheets that bleed, popping out behind thin trees, wearing the faces of a corpses, unable to escape from a monster because you're feet are sinking in globs of wet plaster, the monster mutilating itself, attacking you, having it's face pulled off to reveal a hideous, grinning, laughing, skull. Trapped in a car with you're dead friends & being unable to escape while the creature kills a parent before you're very eyes. The acting is superb, especially for a 1980's slasher flick, most notably being RONEE BLAKELY as the alcoholic mother & JOHN SAXON as her loving father & chief of police. ROBERT ENGLUND plays the role of FREDDY KRUGER, with such relish, he makes him look, seem & feel terrifyingly real & HEATHER LANGENKAMP is perfection as Nancy, & who can forget JOHNNY DEPP'S excellent performance as her boyfriend who winds up eaten by his own bed! (Now I ask you what other movie out there can you see Johnny Depp eaten alive by his own bed?) What's most notable about the film compared to the sequels, is how the door on the house Nancy lives in is blue & in all the other sequels it's red & how Freddy's sleeves on his shirt are all red & the rest of the shirt is a dark red & green coloured stripes, this too would change starting with the next sequel. Using Freddy sparingly here, also helps make him more mysterious & extra creepy, we hardly see him until the end. Unlike the sequels that followed, Freddy is a dead serious maniac, he's not spouting jokes & one liners & bad puns & I felt that's what destroyed the series true potential & made the villain look even less scary. Craven's direction is perfection & his script is very well written & inventive, by having a villain attack you in you're dreams is an interesting plot twist, add to that & the fact that waking up does not necessarily save you, because he killer can follow you into you're world to finish the job he started & you have winner all around & it scares me to think that if Wes was taken away from his script & other writers & directors hired on, how A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET could so easily have become just another standard slasher film full of profanity, naked girls & stereotyped characters, with a by the numbers body count & paper thin plot, with no twists & turns, suspense, terror & tension, like virtually all the other horror films released to theatres when this film emerged. Unlike the sequels that followed that were made strictly for profit, you can see the heart & determination went into making the film & how well it holds up compared to other films of it's kind. Craven's trademarks are also prevalent in the film, the ordinary innocent characters thrust into a horrifying event as it unfolds, strong female characters, the hideous depictions of sadistic, deformed, realistically brutal ki ller, the villain who had brutally murdered an innocent child social issues, family breakdowns, the brutal graphic violence, the lead who uses booby traps to catch the maniac. The characters are interesting. At one point, Nancy even dreams of a death before it happens & tries to prevent it, when she wakes up. It really plays all the themes & things that can happen in a nightmare to a perfect hilt. Unlike he was in the films to follow, Freddy really does depict what a scary, nightmare maniac probably would do & act like if there was one in reality. One thing that always bugged me though, is how Nancy's boyfriend GLEN doesn't seemingly have nightmares even though, like the other three friends, he too lives on the same street & his parents also have a connection to Kruger's death. I always found that odd & I like the twist Wes has in the script where Nancy's mom has bars installed over all the windows & has the locks changed in attempt to protect her daughter, only for it to backfire with Nancy becoming a prisoner with the manic in the house, leaving her with no chance of an escape to try & save herself. The score is pretty creepy & there is the requisite amounts of bloody carnage on hand to help wet the appetite of gore hounds. Watch for a sequence that was re-used from Craven's earlier film DEADLY BLESSING where an evil lurks in the bathtub while a heroine is in it, but does not realize what is happening. Despite it's low budget qualities, the film has one nifty sequence where the badly burned remains of Nancy's mother falls into the spirit world that opens in her bed to swallow her up. The film only falters when it's let down by such a horrible ending that undermines what is otherwise a first rate shocker. A must see for any horror fan, in fact if you haven't seen the film, don't dare call yourself a horror fan until you have! Remade in 2010. Followed by a t.v. series & seven sequels, staring with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2: FREDDY'S REVENGE **** stars"
26124,"WAAAAAY ahead of its time!; Even though this movie was made in 1964, it puts to shame the more recent (and astronomically more expensive) ""Mission to Mars"" and ""Red Planet"". The characters act much more like real people/enslaved extraterrestrials than was common in sci-fi films of that era. Mantee is well-trained and resourceful, handling most problems (with the exception of his forced isolation) with reasonable aplomb. He is much closer to what we expect an astronaut to be than the ridiculous characters from MtM and RP. The equipment is also a notch above the usual 60s fare, with real cables, actual dials and knobs, and that utilitarian look so common in military hardware. I have to give this film and extra half-star just for the realistic technology. Overall, a good, solid sci-fi film from the golden age. Like many others, I'm waiting for the DVD. *** out of *****"
5504,"How Could You Not Like This Film?; I don't know why IMDb's user base is being so tough on this movie, but what really amazed me about it, besides the beautiful production design and use of special effects, is how much I know I would have loved it as a kid. It is SUCH a fun kid's fantasy, with gadgets, creatures, and the chance to act grown up without grossing people out. I liked this movie a great deal; not sure why it's being maligned here. What's also interesting about it is Robert Rodriguez's ability to work his Mexican pride into this film. While there are a lot of great Latino filmmakers, I think it's cool how Robert Rodriguez is able to put Hispanics into the mainstream, be it with his casting or with his films themselves. I've always said that as much as I love the indie heroes, the mainstream have the power to effect real change, and it's nice to see that actually at work."
43608,"Father Knows Best at Armageddon; While very dated, this movie is great campy fun. The father, Ray Milland, is unflappable and knows what to do in almost every circumstance. I particularly loved the buying supplies scene. I remember watching this many times on t.v. growing up and loving it. It should be seen as a window to an earlier ,more innocent time. The belief in survival of nuclear disaster by simple means reminds me of ""duck and cover"" drills from my elementary school days. There is quite a statement about humanity given when everything starts to fall apart and the townspeople's true nature starts to show through. The film makes a ""Rod Serling"" type of image of how humans act when the chips are down. In this respect the movie makes a bold statement while still being a B movie full of extreme seriousness that is fun."
1332,"A bit disjointed, but overall a good film; After his wife dies, police psychiatrist Cal Jamison (Martin Sheen) moves with his son, Chris (Harley Cross), from Minnesota to New York City. There, he quickly becomes embroiled in a bizarre string of occult-related murders of children and apparent suicides of adults. If you enjoyed The Serpent And The Rainbow (1988), Angel Heart (1987) and Rosemary's Baby (1968), there's a good chance you'll enjoy The Believers as well, as it bears quite a few similarities (although it's certainly not a rip-off). In my view, it's not quite as good as those other three films, which are all 10s in my book, but it is well worth watching. The principle flaw, which probably arises from trying to condense a novel--in this case Nicholas Conde's book, The Religion--into a screenplay, is that The Believers quickly brushes over some developments so that it's occasionally difficult to follow, especially towards the beginning. We can sense that there's much more to the story but that there just isn't time to show all of it to us. However, a characteristic of the subgenre of occult/voodoo horror films is a prominent surrealism and dream-like narrative flow, so what might be more of a flaw in another kind of film can be more of an asset here. The Believers also benefits from a great cast--Sheen is a delight to watch (and listen to) as a psychiatrist who can fly off the handle in rage at the drop of a hat, and Jimmy Smits is wonderfully insane every time we see him. The Believers is also worth checking out for its cinematography and set design. The set for the climax is a visual treat and integral to the plot. And the tag scene after the climax is remarkable for its visual change--beautiful, wide-open spaces and bright colors. It's just too bad that the sequel set up by director John Schlesinger never came to fruition."
7361,"Original love story; I was pleasantly surprised at the depth and poignancy of this movie. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are fantastic! Their acting brings much more to the movie than just dialogue. Although they wanted their memories erased at first, it was only because they loved each other so much. This love causes them to constantly bicker and disagree, but they didn't realize how lucky they were to have each other until they almost lost each other forever. Really there are very few people in life worth erasing forever. I actually can think of 2 people I'd gladly erase from my life. The only reason I might not erase them is because I learned a lot from the experiences and I do not want to make those same mistakes again. Joel and Clementine have something so special that when they meet a second time as strangers, they still find a connection! It does seem that they are soul mates. They realize that they want the same things in life, but not necessarily in the same order. They must agree to disagree and not take every discussion as a personal attack. This movie makes you think so much about your own love life and friends that it's frightening! This is one of the few movies that you will continue to think about long after you've seen it. Winslet and Carrey definitely deserved their Golden Globe nominations. This movie is a must see!"
2826,"Beowulf meets Die Hard; In the early years of the 10th century, an exiled Arabian nobleman falls in with a band of Vikings. Disgusted by their poor hygiene and their barbaric ways, he nevertheless reluctantly agrees to accompany them to a distant kingdom, where an unspeakable menace terrorizes the land. This is an interesting interpretation of the tale of Beowulf, with the monster Grendel transformed into the fierce Wendol, a tribe of cannibalistic Neanderthals who have somehow survived long past their time. Despite the fact that Banderas is the title character and credited as the star, he is not the hero here at all. The band of 13 is led by the huge and intimidating Buliwyf (read Beowulf), a hero among his people who must battle both the Wendol and their deadly ""mother."" Alexander Gudonov lookalike Vladimir Kulich is the hero of this film, and delivers a strong, amazing performance. Banderas spends much of the film bumbling, stumbling, screwing up and trying to keep up with the Vikings, who look upon him with contempt but finally, perhaps grudgingly, accept him. Okay, so it's not entirely historically accurate and suffers from production problems and an occasional overdose of testosterone, but it's not a bad movie by any means. The casting is great, with standout performances by the aforementioned Kulich as well as Dennis Storhoi as Herger, Banderas's translator and only friend; the handsome Scottish actor Tony Curran (in an unlikely kilt, but who cares?!?!) as the Celt Weath and the woefully underrated Richard Bremmer as the intimidating tattooed redheaded (and damn sexy!) Skeld. The film was worth watching for these three men alone, but then, I am female and perhaps a bit prejudiced in my opinions. These guys are HOT! But, I digress... Beautiful scenery, tense and bloody battles and a claustrophobic climax in a bone strewn cave lift this movie well above average. There's something for everyone here; fans of horror, fans of action, fans of classic literature should all find something to enjoy about this film. It may not be the best film ever made, but its still one of my very favorites."
1972,"The weakest of all the Nightmare films.; A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 5: THE DREAM CHILD just wasn't scary at all, heck it wasn't even funny, something else the last instalment had going for it, with Freddy's bad puns & jokes. The body count also disappoints, since it's quiet low in the kills department (Three) with few teens dying & odder still, Freddy never once uses his glove to kill anyone! & what's even sadder, the kills were more silly than scary or inventive, for instance, a teen is turned into a comic strip & shredded to pieces by Freddy, another teen is fed her guts until she chokes, while another is morphed into some H.R. GEIGER like creature after he is brutally made one with the motor bike he is riding! No doubt the kills looked & sounded clever on paper, but they are poorly executed here & are all outdated & not even up to series par. I mean come on, whose idea was it to have a ""Super Freddy"" with a cape, turning a kid to paper & slashing him to pieces? What kind of drugs were the writers on? & the films story is not very good either, failing to draw the viewer in. The explanation for Freddy's return is not as silly as it was in IV, (no flaming dog urine here!) thankfully but still made very little sense. What's notable here is how Newline returned to the darker look of the first three, abandoning the flashy colourful look of the fourth, while at the same time, keeping the comedic Freddy of that film, but the clash of both the comedic Freddy & the darker, harder edge tones of the first three, don't mesh well at all. I did like the theme of Freddy being able to resurrect himself, via Alice's unborn child's nightmares & feeding it the souls of the victims he kills, while he slowly, but surely turns the child into something like himself. The film also showed many signs of last minute tampering to reduce gore & please the MPAA, but this results in an even blander film. I think one of the main problems I had with the plot is how Amanda Kruger, according to newspaper clippings, hung herself but her body was never found & how her soul is trapped within the asylum & that a head stone was made for her & placed in a cemetery, with no casket under the ground. This alone creates all kind of contradictions to the third film, which saw Amanda roaming about the grounds of the hospital & cemetery, so how could her spirit be trapped in the asylum? & how do the papers know she hung herself, if her body was never found? Where was she In part 4? Another thing that bugged me was how Alice's best friend Yvonne, was able to find Amanda's body via a staircase leading up to a sealed off room (like none of this would have looked suspicious to anyone working there at the time, or the authorities) its an extremely disappointing moment in the film & goes to show how much thought was put into the script. Also Amanda, was a much older woman in III, here she's a woman in her mid twenties/early thirties & the small closed down wing of the hospital she was raped in many years ago (Seen in III) is now a huge, Gothic like structure of an abandon hospital! despite a somewhat intriguing idea for a plot, the film is poorly handled, with it's execution on screen coming off as laughable in parts. Alice's son Jacob also has quiet the vocabulary for a ten year old boy who is yet to be born & be around adults. But perhaps the most glaring plot contradiction of all, is how Freddy is shown here in a flashback as a baby, just recently born through Amanda in the hospital, but he's a monster! how is this possible since Freddy was born a normal looking kid, that grew up to be a child murderer that got torched to death by the parents of Springwood? I should note that this sequence was actually taken from an early unused draft of NIGHTMARE III. I also could also spot some three or four different editing mistakes throughout the film. It seems that in a rush to get this out, the film-makers never bothered to take care of any of these continuity errors. Freddy is hardly anything you would call scary here & his bad puns are just ridiculous & juvenile. As is the films many sequences, such as Kruger pursuing one teen on a skateboard! Now I will give the film some props, the characterization of the teens is better here than it was in previous instalments & the production design is well handled & Gothic looking, especially the Elm street home & the closed down asylum. The direction by STEPHEN HOPKINS is pretty decent for the most part & the acting is pretty passive (mainly a few of the leads), while others border on poor. The stop motion animation done during a refrigerator sequence is well handled & neat. The visual effects are really good. In the end, Freddy's biggest fans will find much to love, but others need not bother. In fact ROBERT ENGLUND'S engaging performance as Freddy is really the only thing keeping this film from completely sinking (he also plays one of the lunatics in the flashback sequence at the beginning as well). Great score by JAY FERGUESON. Followed by FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE ** stars"
3753,"For crying out loud, it's a  movie.; This, like Braveheart, is a good entertaining movie, not a history lesson. It does capture the essence of feeling which history demonstrates was expressed in colonial America, complete with the reluctance of approximately 1/3 of the population to revolt and the outright opposition by another 1/3. I especially enjoy watching it after hearing the British press bash the US, or the French trying to cover up their culpability in so many underhanded schemes. Many people posting here seem to take the popularity of this movie as a signal of hatred for the British. As an American, I do not hate the British. (I feel sorry for them that such a literate country can have a press as bad as, or worse than ours.) The revolution was 228 years ago, and a great deal of international cooperation has taken place since then between our countries since then. Certainly we are upstarts, loud, cowboys and disobedient to British interests. We are mostly descendants of Christian zealots who left Europe due to the persecution our ancestors encountered there. As a descendant of puritans, Huguenots, German and Dutch reforms, I am forever grateful for what they have given me, and will strive to pass this on to my grandchildren. If this is misconstrued as hatred of the British, I would suggest that the hatred comes from the opposite side of the Atlantic. Hitler called us a mongrel nation - to this and current criticisms I reply, that's who we are, get over it."
8984,"Oceans 11 is forced into returning the money they stole last time while gaining a new team member.; I think that the other people on this website are being to harsh on this movie. I think that this movie was one of the best movies of the year. I'd probably give it a 9/10. People think it is stupid when an actor or actress play their selves in a movie, i think that it is a good idea and a little funny as well. i also think that giving the money back is a little stupid, but what ever. Julia Roberts is very good and pretending not to know herself. everyone who thinks otherwise should get a life. seeing all these great actors and actresses is amazing! once again i think that this is an Excellent movie, go see it today!"
8783,"Top notch acting and a haunting story... but a disappointing ending; Of Shyamalans previous movies I only liked 'Signs', so I'm hardly a fan of him. Still, there was some anticipation surrounding this movie, with it's superb cast and an interesting plot. It involves a small town hidden in the woods, where the people have some sort of truce with the creatures from those woods: they won't come in the village if the people don't go into their territory. This way, the small village has no bonds with the outside world. Problems arise when a young man called Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) is stabbed and desperately needs medication from the outside world. His blind girlfriend Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) sets out to seek help, through the woods, into the wide world. In the first hour of the film, it's perfectly balanced between the scares of the creatures and the relationships unfolded, but once Ivy sets out into the woods the movie loses it's momentum. Although I filled the box 'spoilers included' I won't go too far with that: an observant viewer might know enough by remembering who the director of this movie is... As said, the ending is rather disappointing. It feels strange to see 'the real world' as we know it. There's a rather useless scene with a patrolman stealing some medication for Ivy... it just didn't really fit in to the movie. What still stands though are the excellent performances by the whole of the cast, with some exceptional acting in particular by the relatively unknown Bryce Dallas Howard and William Hurt as her father. On the whole one would perhaps expect more after it's first hour, but 'The Village' still is a movie to watch, as it's truly scary at times and has some of the best performances of the year. Edit: after watching the movie for the second time I feel I have to upgrade it to a 7/10. Special notice to the scene where Lucius grabs Ivy's hand for the first time. Perfect scene."
153,"Was that over the top, i can never tell !; In some cases yes it was a little over the top, but this still had some minor qualities that the original two batman films had and that is thats to Tim Burton who remained as producer for this other wise we would have had a Batman & Robin on our hands and thankfully that didn't happen here. Joel Shumacher came on board and totally changed the look to the franchise which in many ways made this film stand out from the originals but he didn't get too far into campyness just yet!!! The story, well yes there is some sort of a story which i think is defiantly better than the one we were reduced to seeing in Batman Returns. Bruce Wayne is fighting the demons in his head about his parents death while as the caped crusader the tow deadly demons Two-Face and the riddler which was great casting and up to this film had always been great casting. The best or should i say outstanding performances in this bat flick was definitely Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as The riddler, Nicole Kidman makes a great Wayne Chick and Val Kilmer is a great Batman but a little too over the top with Bruce Wayne and finally the character i despise the most, Chris O'Donnel who made a rubbish robin and to me it didn't make me feel sympathetic for the character it just made me loath him more. My overall opinion on Batman Forever is that its a great entry in the Batman Franchise and does it justice but in some places too campy by far and a bit over the top but Joel Shumacher gives some good direction but in some places very little. So why watch this movie, well its a great film to sit and watch on a Saturday night with a takeaway and a beer and its great, i'd just like to add though that i think Tim Burton was right to jump off the band wagon when he did. ******* OUT OF **********"
3177,"Better than Friday; This weekend I thought I'd run through the first two of the Friday trilogy, and after I saw the first one, I was somewhat disappointed. Chris Tucker and Ice Cube were great, along with John Witherspoon, but this movie could have been so much better. Next Friday, now, this was good. It was hysterical. I would have liked to see Chris Tucker in it, but Mike Epps coming into the role as Ice Cubes cousin in a nice suburb was awesome. John Witherspoon was again hilarious here and Debo was back in it breaking out of jail. The Mexican neighbors were hilarious, and so was Roach. This movie had more of a plot than the first one and it was a lot more funny. Now, I need to watch Friday After Next to finish the trilogy. Chris Tucker is one of my favorite actors and I can't wait until Rush Hour 3. I gave Friday-6, and Next Friday- 8. Also, if you guys haven't seen Coach Carter, you should definitely go out and see it."
4098,"They just don't make them like this anymore!; An exquisite film. They just don't make them like this any more! We eavesdrop on an upper middle class family in Dublin in the early part of the 20th century. They are hosting an after Christmas dinner for their friends and relatives. Their table talk is just idle chatter but it is so well written that one is engrossed. Away from the dinner table some fine piano playing helps to create an intimate atmosphere as if one were there as one of the guests. Perhaps a bit too perfect for an amateur player, the odd mistake here and there would have added to the magic of this film. No real story but real entertainment and an object lesson for up and coming film makers."
8636,"Tonight we have Superman 4 or Spider-Man 2.; When we were done watching this movie my Best Friend had the nerve to ask ""So... what did you think?"". My other friend and I looked at each other and all I had to say was ""OH MYYYYYY GGGGOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDD! That was the longest movie I've ever seen."" They should have put the Spider symbol on the Hulk and rolled two really really bad movies into one. It seems that Marvel Comics only have two settings. They either make a really good movie or a movie where you wish you had a shot gun blast to the face. Recently, it has been the latter of the two. Back to Spider-Man 2. The script was horrible. I was waiting for the Preschool fighting words of ""You arn't invited to my birthday party!"" to spew from Mary Jane's mouth. Funny enough when she was asked if Peter was invited to the wedding, she said ""No."" Why didn't the SWAT team take Doc Ock out when he was robbing the bank? When he was climbing the building with Aunt Mae, did anyone find it funny that New York's Finest would just open fire at any building in New York? The list goes on and on. One more question... In New York is there Spider-Man insurance? Because when he was trying to stop that train he rip some really big holes in those buildings. If your property is damaged by a Super Hero do you think insurance covers that?"
123117,"One of the Best Movies of all time!; Jeff Bridges stars in this very humorous story about a guy who is considered to be a loser by his wife, his boss (his father-in-law), and everyone who knows him. He decides to change his life, and become the man he has always wanted to be. Many men will relate to this story. It serves as a real eye-opener, showing how the power of positive thinking and self-respect can influence those around us, and help us change our fate if we choose to so so. The movie, directed by William Richert, is very fun and enjoyable to watch, and should be considered an American classic...It currently has a substantial cult following, and it is extremely hard to find. All Jeff Bridges fans should definitely see it. There are some scenes which may seem controversial by today's standards, but the movie was ahead of it's time in several ways, just like the Bridges film ""Winter Kills"". Look for the version titled ""Success""... it is the best version to see if you can find it. (Other titles include ""American Success Company"", ""Good as Gold"" or ""The Ringer"")."
5989,"Hard to believe its true; I Don't know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by Frank Abagale Jr. himself, then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience. It's hard to believe that people were so naive, that they allowed Frank Abagnale to achieve what he did, but i have give the guy credit for pushing the system, and riding the high life for as long as he did. Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job of capturing the character of Frank Abignale Jr. (strange i didn't picture him in the role of a jet setting Gigalo) and the rest of the cast although only little more than fringe characters, are all very well cast and give typically fine performances, as you would expect with the calibre of Hanks and Walken. All in all this is a fine film, that most people will enjoy watching 8/10"
33587,"Above average, but flawed; Roderick Fitzgerald (Ray Milland) and his sister Pamela (Ruth) happen upon a charming old mansion on a seacoast 300 miles from London. They track down the present owner as Commander Beech (Donald Crisp), and after a brief refusal from Beech's granddaughter, Stella (Gail Russell), they meet with Beech, who agrees to sell it to them for the remarkably low sum of 1200 pounds! The price is that low because there are rumors, at least, that the house might be haunted. The Uninvited tells us what happens when the Fitzgerald's move in. While this film is usually classified as a horror film (the Internet Movie Database has it as ""Horror/Romance""), and it does have some superficial resemblances to both Rebecca (1940--a film I love and which was supposed to be an influence on this one) and The Haunting (1963--a film I disliked quite strongly on my last viewing), it's better to approach The Uninvited primarily as a mystery. There are horror elements, but they are a very minor part of the plot and take up very little screen time. Calling it a ""romance"" seemed odd to me at first, but when you think about it, the romance aspect of the film takes up just as much time as the horror aspect. But 90-something percent of the film is in the realm of mystery, albeit a slow-paced mystery that's mostly dialogue. And that fact brought my rating down a couple notches. The Uninvited is one of the few times that I think application of a literary ""rule"" would have improved a work. In this case, the rule that is broken is ""show, don't tell"". The mystery that is the heart of the film's plot is long in the past, so all we receive are characters talking about it--telling us, and figuring out, a story. At that however, what might have been a 6 out of 10 from me, at best, was brought up due to the very clever dialogue, which usually contains a very subtle and quick sense of humor. On the downside, the dialogue was also a bit confusing every once in a while, especially given that two crucial characters in the mystery are a woman referred to as ""Mary Meredith"" and a man usually referred to only as ""Meredith"". The fine black & white cinematography is another bonus, as is the horror material (all in the guise of a haunted house) those few times that it is present. The effects were particularly impressive, especially given the era, although note that some editions of the film apparently are missing the most prominent effects--a fact that would lessen the quality of the film in my opinion."
27455,"actually really good....; this is definitely the best of the new godzilla series (i haven't seen Final Wars yet). Godzilla looks really good, and the music blows away any others in the series. The plots not great but compared to the new pieces of junk plots like Godzilla against mechagodzilla and Godzilla: Tokyo SOS, its a masterpiece. The fighting is pretty well done, but could have used better monsters. It was clear that the monsters stood no chance of even fighting godzilla, let alone beating him. You know it when Godzilla fires his breath at Baragon once and he disintegrates. I liked how the army forces played almost no part in this, which i like because thats all most of the new series is. Anyway best in the ""mellenia"" series, maybe besides godzilla 2000. 8/10"
8973,"Almodovar Does Hitchcock; Enrique Goded, played by Fele Martinez, is a young film director in 1980 Madrid enjoying his first commercial success. Ignacio, played by Gael Garcia, an old schoolmate who is now an actor, visits and leaves behind a story he has written inspired by their time together in a Catholic boarding school for boys. Goded decides to use the material for his next film and to let Ignacio play himself. Through a series of intricately plotted flashbacks, we learn about the two men's childhood friendship, their relationship with a disturbed priest, and a secret that won't go away. Director Pedro Almodovar is obviously a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock. The movie is full of Hitchcock's trademark tricks, including elaborate studio sets, a plot twist involving impersonation, and a musical score that could have been composed by Bernard Hermmann. La Mala Educacion tells a satisfying story with unexpected twists about characters who are driven by passion. Highly recommended."
1218,"cinematic ally perfect!; i saw this film when i was first starting to get into john woo and hong Kong 'heroic bloodshed' movies and i heard about this, saw it on DVD and thought it was not only one of the best Hong Kong movies ever made but just one of the coolest movies ever made! everything about it is incredible, chow Yun- Fat in one of the greatest performances he will ever do, john woo's masterful directing and choreographs gun play scenes and just the extremeness of it all make it far superior to 'a better tomorrow' trilogy 'tragic hero' and 'just heroes'. It's just so perfect and represents what a genius combo it is when these two stars are put together. Now whether the title sounds bad or not it does not matter to me I WANT THE KILLER 2 I WANT THE KILER 2 I WANT THE KILER 2!"
6874,"Tarantino is well and truly back!!!; I saw ""Kill Bill"" on the opening night in my local cinema and walked out with my jaw on the ground, my hair standing on end and completely speechless. I can say nothing good about that movie that wouldn't be a complete understatement The sound track as usual for Tarantino's movies is second to none from start to finish even if you don't like the movie(Which you would have to be retarded not to) you still have a fantastic sound track to listen to. Tarantino's love of Hong Kong cinema and kung fu movies shines through clearly in this movie and for fellow fans of the genre its a fitting homage to them. If you haven't seen it make sure u do asap you will not regret it"
3726,"Great Film; This is the first film that I can say scared the heck out of me, of course I was 10 at the time (now I'm 30). I saw it recently and fell in love with it. The story of the last day of a Police precinct in Los Angeles and the battle the people inside have with a street gang is incredible. Why the producers of the remake choose to change the story I will never understand. This is a movie about a group of people that are stuck inside a building, out gunned and out manned, but manage to survive. Everyone should see this film. The opening scene with the murder of a little girl at an ice cream truck is one of the most heart wrenching scenes I have ever seen. This movie deserves a lot more attention that it has received over the years. There might not have been a lot of money spent on the production of this film but it is one of the best action films of the last 30 years."
30816,"reality to legend to novel to movie to musical to movie musical; Novelist Gaston Leroux was convinced the Opera Ghost had existed. His belief was based on mysterious happenings at the Paris Opera House (including the kidnapping of singer Christine Daaé, the disappearance of the Vicomte de Chagny, and the murder of his brother, Count Phillippe), and a letter Christine had written before her disappearance. Some believe the the opera ghost was responsible for all three crimes. Some believe that the Vicomte & his brother were vying for Christine and the Vicomte murdered his brother. Some believe that after their disappearance Christine and her Vicomte lived out their lives together in some secret unknown place. All this intrigue has very little to do with Leroux's novel nor with the theatrical productions based on it. A subterranean lake does in fact exist in the lower levels of the Paris Opera House. It was discovered during construction. It was one of the factors that delayed completion of the opera house for almost fifteen years. It was decided that the best thing to do was to leave the lake there and work with it. I had the good fortune to visit the Paris Opera House many years ago, and in the movie theater yesterday I felt like I was there. I'm quite sure that it was not shot on location, so I'm impressed. As far as the casting of the lead roles, I defer to the taste of Andrew Lloyd Webber himself. At first I was disappointed in the Phantom's voice, but as he becomes more angry and violent, his voice matches the drama. I find it interesting that Webber would cast the former lead singer in a rock band for his Phantom - but Webber's phantom is in essence a rock star - sexy, intriguing, edgy, and dangerous. He's the archetypal man your mother warned you about. The first time we hear Christine sing, her voice is soft and hesitant, as one would expect the first time a child is thrown unexpectedly into the limelight. In her first song we hear her voice grow to what I can only describe as amazing for an eighteen-year-old actress. She was perfectly cast - a young, innocent girl, living a sheltered existence, knowing very little of the real world (the opera house is her world). She's frightened of and yet helplessly pulled in by the overpowering predatory personality of the Phantom, and finding true love at the same time with Raoul. I loved Raoul from the moment I saw him on screen. A few things bothered me. Raoul had to be at least twenty years younger than Mme. Rémy, and yet in the black & white scenes they appeared to be about the same age. The audio often didn't sync with the video. The most glaring example of that was at the beginning of ""Masquerade."" For an entire line the singing was exactly one beat off from the lips. They had to have done it on purpose - perhaps they thought the dancing fit the music better one beat off, so they decided to just edit it that way and hope nobody noticed. I guess they didn't want to set up the scenery, costumes, etc. and re-shoot just to fix 5 seconds. The other instances weren't so glaring, but they were still disconcerting, and makes me think that for such an elaborate production they were in an awful hurry to get it out of production and in front of the public. I really wish they had taken the time to get it right. Other than the technical problems that at times were disconcerting, I was supremely entertained, as I was when I saw the play. So much has been made of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" but when it comes down to it, it's just great fun."
30816,"An aesthetic masterpiece; Being a fan of the original, I was a bit speculative of going to see it on the big screen. In my past experience of seeing stage to screen adaptations, the result has either been fantastic (as in this, and in Chicago), or unnecessary, as in Hello Dolly, or even (shock horror) The Sound of Music, the latter of which was, while beautifully set, merely only a success based upon the current success of the musical at the time. It was, in a word, a cult, and still remains. Luckily though, this result was a success. The theatre was mind blowing in its beauty and aesthetics, and was quite similar in its look to the grand French theatres of the age. However, a good looking film is not enough in itself to become a great film. It was also, thankfully terrificly cast, and cast with a group of relatively new actors. While we had some experience with the extremely charismatic Minnie Driver, who easily, despite her small part had fantastic screen presence, and accurately depicted the part of Carlotta, who indisputably is the original Diva. Experience was also had with Simon Callow, a fantastic British actor who never fails to impress. Although sadly, we did not really get enough of his acting ability in his rather unexciting role. New to the big screen, however, was the star, Emily Rossum. She was an accurate depiction of the virgin star who is naive enough to succumb to the evil phantom's spell. Which leads on to the real star of the show. Gerard Butler's performance as the Phantom was incredible. He was able to contrast the Phantom's two sided personality, that of the overly-protective and obsessed megalomaniac, and that of the caring, and heartbroken lamb. While feeling bitter hate for the character, you could not help but feel for him and this would have been Lloyd Webber's main intention in originally writing the script. The main reason that this gets only an 8, however, is simply because, despite its splendour, this really is a stage production, and does not have the atmosphere and excitement of the original show. While the performances are excellent, and it looks terrific, it misses this atmosphere, and those that have enjoyed the picture should really go down the West End to see exactly what I mean."
8190,Things Change!; First saw this one in '68 at height of Vietnam War just before MASH. Then the idea of that nation-to-be destroying the downtown part of NYC seemed a bit far fetched. Instead the hard hats and hippies had at each other. Years later after war was directly brought to bunch of large financially important structures and the smell of death floated across NYC...it's a little harder to accept the premise that not killing a killer has merit. Plain and simple it's them or us in real life. The rest is make believe. Film then was fun and enjoyable for performances. Now I need a shot of Windtalkers as a bracer to keep perspective. There are really some people who would do you harm just to do you harm. Forget motives or purposes. Emily mixes it all up which only plays out on celluloid. In heat of action it is safer to be aware that not everyone loves you or your saintly behavior.
1617,"Tough, Highly Entertaining, and well acted thriller; L.A. Confidential is about police corruption in the 1950's. The acting is great, of course you can never go wrong with Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe, but there are plenty of great supporting actors like Guy Pierce, Jim Cromwell, and Kim Bassinger. (Possible Spoilers) The story is centered around a shooting in a diner that leads to a trail of mystery, violence, and corruption. The suspects of the shooting are a group of black guys who steal shotguns, one of the victims is an associate of a mysterious multimillionaire, another victim is a fellow cop. Three cops, Sgt. Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey), Officer Wendell White(Russell Crowe), and Detective Lt. Ed Exley(Guy Pierce) use their own morals and skills to try to figure out what seemed like just a diner bloodbath, but is a lot more than what it seemed. There is plenty of excitement and entertainment in L.A. Confidential, and the acting is really good. Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey had back to back Oscar nominations after making this movie. L.A. Confidential is a little bit confusing the first time you see it, so it does deserve more than one viewing. I'd recommend this for the next time you want to watch a movie that is entertaining and has a good story."
8376,"This movie vividly sucks!; OK, this movie got way too much media attention. What should have been said of the movie is this ""It has no plot!"" You can tell by the previews, but it is even more illustrated by the way the movie goes. The basis of the movie is...there is no basis. It has a few funny characters and a petefial uncle with llamas. There is nothing hysterical about it. There are a few places where you can giggle, but it is nothing to get your panties in a twist over. I am usually a fan of indie films, but this movie...poorly made and just very stupid. If you are on drugs while watching you may enjoy it, otherwise there is no point to watching it. It is an hour and a half waste of time."
8376,"Beautifully Done; I rolled up laughter at the ridiculous but quite realistic scenarios presented to us from Napoleon's world. I think this film has a little something for everyone, but only if you remember there's no traditional story to be told, its just a peek into this chap's life. I feel that many people will be able to identify with the characters, either through being them or knowing someone like them, regardless of nationality. Its that element of this film that reaches out to the audience and speaks volumes. The scenery and domestic settings for the film adds to the aspect that time is standing still in this town, so are the people. It also points out to the audience that life can be pretty absurd and hilarious occasionally. I recommend watching this on a lazy Sunday afternoon with a cup of tea and digestive biscuits! Heaven."
2529,a boring movie; I thought that this movie was an OK movie. I'm glad they re rated it b/c there are about 8 swear words in it and Charlton Heston's pants come down a few times to only expose his behind nothing else. I haven't seen the new movie but I thought this one was not worth watching. This was not a movie the whole family would enjoy. I know I didn't enjoy it that much. I did like the ending though but it was a little hard to understand. PLease think before you go and watch this movie
8957,"I Was On The Edge Of My Seat; Saw is about two men who have been captured by a sick freak and locked in an old bathroom. They later find two micro tapes that tell them that one must kill the other or his wife and kid will get it. Of course the history of the two men comes into play as they search the room for clues as to how they can escape. Oh my goodness! Only two movies have I seen in theaters where I was like: ""OH MY GOD!!!! HURRY UP, MOFO!"" The other was Panic Room (10/10). The acting was awesome, although Cary Elwes's American accent was.... interesting. The writing was brilliant as was the directing. I love independent films and this is a prime example of how awesome and original they can be. This is a must-see for anyone who enjoys a good suspense film. You go, director guy, you go! I am anxious for a Saw 2. Hopefully they will continue the story and not make it a repeat of the horrible tortures that were inflicted upon innocent (or are they?) people in the first. My final rating: 10/10."
6338,"Mixed Feelings; I've seen this movie a couple of times and I'm feeling rather mixed about it. On one level I have a new kind of respect for Eddie, seeing him in a nice family movie that I can show my baby cousins and still laugh at myself. However I also know that we've passed the point of no return on this one, we will never again see the strong 80's Eddie that we once loved. I suppose we should look at this as a new chapter in the career of one of America's funniest men, and while it is depressing I'm still slightly awed that Eddie is still on the scene. After several blundering movies and one very sorry attempt at singing stardom we find an enduring man who can in fact change with the times. So for all the Daddy DayCare bashers I think you should just be glad the our favorites Murphy man is still around."
31221,"At least the popcorn was good.; I think director Rob Bowman said it best when describing this movie as ""the longest, most expensive bowel movement I've ever taken"". If you're going to make an action movie you ought to throw in a little action just for fun. The story was weak, the acting was poor. Even the cinematography was hackneyed. I feel very comfortable in saying this will be the worst movie I saw in 2005. It would have been passable as a madefor TV movie. Where do I write to get my $30 back? Hmmm, I still need afew lines. Jennifer Garner looked good in her red Elektra costume. Idon't know. I can't say enough to warn you not to pay money to see thisfilm. Imagine someone trying to make Mortal Kombat into a ""seriousfilm"" and you can pretty much guess what Elektra will be like."
5620,"offensive!  and nothing special; Offensive. Just plain offensive. I can handle the characterization of the people of Alabama as poor backwards hicks that live in trailers, take our infants to bars and reenact the war again' northern oppression. I can handle the 'Hollywood Sud-thren' accents too. No, what offends me is that the folks who put this watered down chick flick on us had Jewel wrap it up by singing ""Sweet Home Alabama"". Why not just throw in Rosanne's rendition of the Star Spangled Banner too! Or have Michael Bolton sing anything. The movie itself was entertaining for the most part, but had the 'cookie cutter hey, lets come up with a good premise, throw a recognizable name in it, come up with a catchy title, drag it out for an hour and a half with a boatload of clichés and have a happy ending' feel to it. My other big complaint was that I never really got a good feel why she liked the New York fiancé so much to start with, or what made her change to want to stay with the Alabama husband. It almost seemed like she decided to go back to the Alabama husband because he 'had finally made a success of himself'. Maybe if the movie was tweaked a bit to where the guy was overweight, balding, lived in a double wide and was on disability after strainin' his back while the night watchman for the Van Atkin's pickle factorythen it would have been believable that she was choosing him cause she loved him."
8636,"Spider-man 1 was the history now the adventure begins....; We pick up from where Peter Parker chose the life of responsibility over his own desires and wants. Peter is a struggling young man who can't even hold a job long enough to live in a better place than he currently is. His feelings for Mary Jane have grown stronger over the last two years, but Mary Jane closes herself to Peter because she feels he won't be there for her. While peter has women trouble, A new villain is born, DOC OCK!!! And what could be worse? Harry and Peter's relationship is going down the tubes big time. A movie about finding you true self, Spider-man 2 is a mix of action and romance. So, if you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're missing."
30894,"White Noise; I went to this movie not for the content (although I do follow true crime and the paranormal from time to time)-I went to see Michael Keaton-who I find extremely diversified and entertaining in his roles. Reviews/opinions from others are not worth my time because my movie values stem from how it use to be. Going to the theater is a form of sheer entertainment and fun for me. No one else's opinion matters but my own and that's the way it should be. White Noise was exactly what I expected it to be: Scary, sad, moving and informative-and just plain entertaining!! Also, the location was perfect for this movie shoot and the camera angles are unique to the quality of this picture. I do recommend this movie to others who want a good ""jumpstart"" and can appreciate off the wall cinema."
27833,"City and Gold; Forgot SNL's Will Farrell, Chris Cooper has perfected the art of impersonating George W. and this is a great movie. It's an entertaining portrayal of government cover-up as well as a biting look into the way some people exploit illegal aliens for cheap labor. Danny Huston gives a decent performance as the investigator covering the case of a dead body found in a Colordo river. The woes of Huston's private life are mostly kept brief, although there are still times when Huston's love life halts the much more interesting case of the dead body. It was a pleasure to see Chris Cooper playing an uncannily-George W.-like Colorado governor candidate and an equal joy to see Richard Dreyfus as a Karl Rove-like adviser."
170705,"it's  a reasonable series, but hardly worth high praise..; BoB is great!!!! I was so curious, I had to look for myself. I was rather surprised.. One of my problems was that I could not connect to the story as the characters were changed with every episode. It looked more like a dramatized documentary than a gripping story. I also found the mood heavily sentimental. At regular intervals you would be confronted by a sad-looking GI, pondering the horror of it all, but then at the next moment ready to do his bit because his fellows depended on him, as he depended on them: they were after all; a band of brothers. I also had problems with the role of the 'europeans'. If they appeared at all, it was in a vague and distant manner, more props then real live persons. More to spark a scene of thoughtful pondering, than to give them their own piece to act. There was a foolishness English tank-commander who was blown to pieces by a tiger despite being warned by the valiant Americans. Had he but listened to them, he would still be alive This event echo's the remark made at the beginning of the episode by one of the vet's: if we had been dropped at Arnhem, the operation would have been a success. Then there was the Belgian damsel, who's only role seem to be to give the protagonist of the episode a moment of sadness. Cruel was fate, snuffing out the live of one so young and beautiful. The Germans had the obvious role allotted to them, like Indians in cowboy series, like Vietcong in Nam series and Russians in cold war movies. As all the baddies do: they stand up, march forward and get gunned down by droves. If they temporarily seem to win it was because there were too many of them or they had tanks. If they lose it was because they had to, faced by the superior Americans. This is underscored by the fact that the only German to rise above the role of target and have more line's than 'argg' or 'scheise' happened to be an German-American who joined the Germans. Eventually as Germans go, he was killed too. Of course triggering another dark moody pondering moment: how cruel was the fate setting up two country-man against each other. At last I found some part of the series plain boring, especially the episode one called bastogne. A large part of the episode we follow the leading character, a medic, wandering through the woods from one place to the other. Nothing really happens. I all: it's a reasonable series, but hardly worth high praise.."
8043,"A heart-warming overlooked classic.; I bet you like me have lots of movies you saw when you were younger, and you remember them being great. Then, years later you get to see these movies, and they aren't that great, you understand that you've grown and that your taste in movies has changed...still some of ""those"" movies remain ""classics"" to you. I have a few of those movies...when I saw that Jack The Bear was coming out on DVD, I ordered a copy right away. I hadn't seen this movie since 93-95. I remember it being very powerful, even got my older brother in tears. Although, I wasn't sure how I would find it now 10-11 years later. I must say, it's truly a very powerful drama. It's very very touching, never seen De Vito this good, the kids, Senise etc - Everyone/everything is great. It's a very heart-warming story, and it feels very ""real"". It's truly a ""classic"" movie, and I must say I even appreciate it more now that I've grown up (26 years old). Still - One of my favorite movies. www.sannelli.com"
3451,"Good movie; I feel sorry for John Seal, the reviewer above, for his views on this movie, as well as his views on interracial marriage. I think this movie is excellent, I enjoyed the performances of all the actors and the message is important. Racial prejudice was common in 1967, and the very first interracial kiss on TV was still to come (it happened in 1969 on Star Trek). People needed to hear the message this movie contains, that color and race are not something that should prevent two people who love each other from marrying. I am a white American married to a Japanese female and I am proud that our children will grow up to live in a world where people have tolerance for different cultures and beliefs. It is sad to watch Spencer Tracy in this movie, knowing he died weeks after it was made. But it was nice that he could act with Katherine Hepburn, the love of his life, so close to his death. That must have made him happy."
139489,"E! True Hollywood Story with a 5th Grade Pakistan History Lesson; This drama cum documentary by Jamil Dehalvi is quite a concoction of E! True Hollywood Story and a 5th Grade Pakistan history lesson which probably only makes sense to those who already believe in the message. The movie has a bazaar theme that Jinnah after his death journeys in time with an angel to review events in his life as well as other's lives. It tries to 'set the record straight' of the events that transpired the creation of Pakistan. Mr. Dehalvi really should have tried to make a documentary instead of using the self-defeating so grossly fictitious approach. The story spends more time portraying the 'juicy' part of Jinnah life, his quarrel with his father-in-law over his marriage to his daughter, his breaking down into tears over the death of his wife and his opposition to his daughter marrying a man outside her faith, rather than building a cohesive portrait of a man who wielded considerable respect and fought bitterly for his vision. Most political events presented in the movie have a bare bone narrative, lack any context and do not help build the overall story. Most of the sequences in the film are bits and pieces taken from historical accounts and run before the audience without much connectivity, simply put this film can be seen in any order and the story line would not be impacted in the least bit. As for the historical accuracy, suffice it to say that the movie does not have any qualms about rewriting history and blatant mudslinging. The movie is obsessed with Jawaharlal Nehru's affair with Mountbatten's wife and literally accuses and convicts Mountbatten of conniving with them and serving their wishes on a silver platter. It presents only the best of Jinnah, the worst of Gandhi and Nehru and is probably grossly simplistic if not out right inaccurate about many events presented such as the accession of Kashmir. The lowest and most hypocritical point of the film comes when the film time travels into the future and in a ""I told you so"" moment Jinnah summarily justifies creation of Pakistan by using Babri Mosque incident. Mr. Dehalvi should know better that what has happened in Pakistan since its inception is also what Gandhi, Nehru and various British officials forewarned about and thought exactly why Pakistan should not be created. From acting point of view, Richard Lintern portrays young Jinnah vibrantly well but Christopher Lee some how does not seem to get out of his Dracula shell and much of the portrayal of older Jinnah is dull, monotonous and zombie-like. One item well below the horizon and was done very well was the symphonic version of Pakistani anthem done by Nigel Clarke and Michael Csanyi-Wills which is one of a kind I have heard."
5809,"A bit below DePalma's usual efforts.; ****SPOILER**** I have to confess up-front that I felt rather cheated by this movie. The twist at the end was not totally unexpected, but I felt that it was WAAAY too much to have the virtually identical sequence of events play out again in real life. This adds a whole new dimension to the character (who is now also apparently prescient/psychic/whatever) and this does not serve the story well. I believe that it would have been much better to just end the movie with the viewer wondering whether or not things will play out as she foresaw them (her ex-partners locate her and Serra, Lily meets Bruce Watts on the plane, etc.) Also, I did not have much sympathy for Laure. This was not simply because she acted so coldly and reprehensibly in her ""vision,"" but because of what she actually HAD done and WOULD do in the future. Here's a woman who gets together with some clearly ruthless and cold-hearted criminals to steal some fantastically valuable jewelry. She did so willingly and must have realized that there was likely to be bloodshed if anything went wrong with the heist. (We can also safely assume that this was not the first crime in which she participated.) She then double-crosses her partners and makes off with the jewelry herself, leaving one of them to spend seven years in prison. She next masquerades as another person, deceiving that person's parents and taking advantage of their love for their daughter. Finally, she meets with her accomplice to split the profits from the heist and apparently has no problem whatsoever in walking off with a satchel of money that she didn't have any right to. Not too admirable behavior in my book, regardless of the sense of ""redemption"" some other reviewers have discussed. ****END SPOILER**** The acting was quite good, especially Black Tie. I'm not sure if Laure Ashe dancing at the pool table in the seduction scene can be considered ""acting,"" but it was pretty interesting, too. (If you know what I mean...and I think that you do.) Unfortunately,Banderas is absolutely wasted in his role. He is over-the-top virtually the entire time he is on-screen. He must have owed somebody a favor and paid it off by appearing in this film. The cinematography was very good and the locations looked authentic (except for the inside of the mechanical room at the theater.) Overall, I give this a *** out of *****...slightly above average, but still a let-down from DePalma."
27434,"A Disappointment; I've learned that if they lable it: ""The scariest movie of the year"" or ""Scarier than 'The Ring'"", it won't be and I should wait until it's available on Netflix. At least I didn't pay for my ticket though. Darkness is about a family of four: mother, father, teenage girl, little boy, who move into a house in Spain. Little do they know about the house's horrific past and the father's links to it. Apparently six kids were murdered there in a part of an evil cult ritual. This movie seemed okay at first. The acting was acceptional. I didn't care about the acting, though. I never do. I just see it as a perk, even though it affects the way I rate movies. The story line was very unfamiliar to me. I had only seen advertisements twice, and I really couldn't tell what was going on. The father seems to have a mental condition that had gone away for a long time. It suddenly seems to come back because of the six ghosts of children that appear throughout the film. Then, the movie took a turn for the worst: the ending. I was so confused. But what I saw, I didn't like so I didn't care if I understood or not. Then, when it was explained to me, I felt a little better about it, but I wouldn't be recommending it to anyone. Although many people thought the ending was cool (the movie even scared one girl sh*tells, I didn't. It had an interesting appeal to it that I would have enjoyed had the events leading up to it been better. I hand it to the director or writer or whoever I should be giving credit to for originality. I will give his next film ""Fragile"" a try, but probably when it's on video. Final rating: 5/10."
8783,"Rod Serling would be proud; I avoided seeing this movie in the theater due to bad reviews and word of mouth. I think I'm glad I did because I, too, probably would have had my impression of the film colored by its false advertising as a horror movie. This movie is not horror -- at all. That being said, my wait for it to come to video was free of any misconceptions about what it was. Distanced from the advertising hype and the bad press, I rented it with little or no expectations about what I was going to see. To my utter delight, what I got to watch was a splendid movie that is a wonderful study of character, mood, suspense, and neat twists that would have made Rod Serling proud. This movie is quintessential ""Twilight Zone"" material only so much more richer for the excellent performances by virtually every cast member and the script which fleshes out a delicate, multi-layered world. All of this would be very difficult to accomplish in a standard 30-minute TZ episode. This movie is a wonderful treat that is quite unusual for standard Hollywood fare. One can only hope that in the future, Hollywood will learn how to develop advertising for films so that it can find its proper audience instead of misleading people into thinking they are going to see something completely different."
3712,"Great Movie!; I have been a fan of this movie for years and years. Because of Teri Hatchers move into the forefront, I had to take the movie off the shelf and watch it. Why people back in 1991 did not see how wonderful this movie was in beyond me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are beyond fabulous. Although I never have watching daytime soap operas, this movie kills me every time I watch it. The acting is second to none for a comedy and the writing is so smart. I highly recommend that you watch this if you haven't already. You will get to see Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, and Carrie Fisher...to name a few...all give splendid performances."
8376,"Brilliance; This movie is better in my opinion than ""Welcome to the Doll House"" against which it is frequently compared. The subtle genius in this film manifests in the characters. Unless you've known people like this, you're not going to get it. The choice of words, the movements, the demeanors, are all perfect. Being somewhat of a nerd growing up, I was surrounded by guys like this. The plot is slow but deliberate. I think this is intentional, and works to produce a very relaxed, very funny movie. I found myself bursting out with laugher in almost every scene. Make no mistake, this is very subtle humor, and the movie as a whole is somewhat of an in-joke. But if you get the joke, you're going to love it."
5618,"Spirited Away; As far as elegance goes, i believe this film has showed that and more. A truly enlightening and heart warming film, Spirited Away has brought me even closer to the fantasy and Japanese world. i very much enjoyed the music which sets the emotion of each scene. i've only seen the English version, and i must say that they did an excellent job on everything. I'm hoping that they come out with a sequel, because Haku (or Kohaku if you've seen the movie)promised they would see each other again. one flaw is that i believe that we should get a clearer background on each characters past. Little things in the movie like Chihiro falling down the steps when she was going to kamaji to ask for a job,her clumsiness while cleaning the 'big tub', and not being able to hold her breath the whole way across the bridge in the beginning of the movie have made her more human like and easy to relate to. This movie is truly a masterpiece and will remain one of my favorite movies of all time. I still hope they make a sequel!!!!! ^_^"
8809,"Delightful; For those of us who enjoy Rhys Ifans, this little film will not disappoint. The story is a universal one of people interacting with people, just being people who have dreams, live day to day lives and then, suddenly, someone does something out of the ordinary and lurches into the limelight. For most, it changes their lives-- often not for the better. In this tale, Dan is a working man looking forward to a simple vacation who's significant other has her eye on the upward rungs of the social ladder and preempts his ""holiday"" plans for a smoozhing opportunity. Dan, on a lark, winds up floating off in a deck chair supported by balloons into a far away town where he winds up in a frustrated local parking control cop's backyard. She proceeds to protect and use him as a foil but things work out as neither planned it. Improbable? Sure. But, it resonates with the delightful performance of the Welsh actor and a bevy of relatively unknown Australians (at least here in the US), led by the delightful Miranda Otto, here speaking in her native Australian English. This is great fun and enjoyably entertaining."
8917,"A must see film might give away what goes on but no real detail; This film is an absolute hit! went to see it on the release date and laughed all the way through! Don't be put off by it being just puppets on strings as once you start to watch it you will just laugh your head off! If you liked south park and any other film which takes the mickey out of people and just plane insanity then this film is a must! the main parts of the film which are so funny are the start when they are trying to save the french from terrorists, when Gary (one of the characters) is singing in a Broadway musical the song is so hilarious, when they all travel to Egypt and try to sneak into find terrorists, and the end where Gary again talks about some very funny and unmissable crude insanity which he picks up on his way to fight for the good fight!! All together i rated this film 10/10 hope you enjoy it as much as i did!!!"
4308,"a story about freedom, beauty, truth and love.; A young writer called Christian comes to Paris. There he meets Tolous and gets a job writing for the show ""spectacular spectacular"". Christian visits the Moulin rouge where he falls in love with the star, Satine. Satine mistakes Christian for the duke and falls in love with him. As the film goes on, they face many challenges to keep their love a secret and the duke interested. At the end Satine realises that Christian is in great danger. She makes him believe she doesn't love him and sends him away. But Christian comes back. When the show is over, the duke is out of the way and Setain and Christian are no longer needing to hide their love, everything looks great. Until the tragedy of Satine dying comes along. This film is the best musical i have ever watched. The songs get stuck in my mind. Better actors could not have been chosen."
4148,"See my first line; This film really made me headache. I am totally against violence. But which made me really don't like the script is that it wants to fashion H into a Dante expert. I understand that even killer has complex human emotions, but Dante has nothing to do with killing a man like that. If a man who masters literature and history could judge other people's life as his wish, then how should we estimate Hitler? I know it's just a film but since Anthony Hopkins' performing is too great, I couldn't help but feel upset for quite a while. We all admit Godfather is great, because whatever he did he insist his principle that family profit is most important, he also had his love and hate but if he showed up with Dante that would be totally unreasonable. I don't like those script writers who add metaphysical meanings onto slaughter just for making a film looks more mystic and attractive. And that female FBI upset me too, why she saved H while she knew she couldn't control the situation by herself? The director did a good job, as well as composer Hans Zimmer. But for me the problem is they are too moderate, I mean, the way the camera rolls, the scenes switch, and the actors perform, just too Hollywood. Everything goes so smooth that I even could hear a voice that says: Look, what a good film am I making! I would answer, yes, congratulations! But why do you make it again?"
3176,"Thrilling but not Jazz; I saw five Ozu's films in the past week and I feel kind of exhausted, so I paid a visit to The Talented Mr. Ripley. You know, it's like after spending four nights for Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, one might be very like to go to a jazz bar to freshen up. The first half hour of this film really made me felt that I am going to enjoy some jazz, but suddenly that shy guy became a killer! I thought, oh what's going on? What's wrong with him and the whole thing? And as time went by I was more and more into his dangerous game. I really didn't want this film to end because I wonder how long he could hold on. The end is dark because he actually killed a man who really loved him, and had no distance left to run. An exciting film, and what left for one to rethink is the complex of humanity. Maybe I didn't quite catch up with the opening, so I am not sure why this talented guy is so sly and false, it seems that he drops those jazz albums advisedly, but his love towards Greenleaf seems is true. So when I see him playing Bach in Greenleaf's house after he killed Greenleaf, I couldn't help but want to search out something behind his big glasses. Maybe the answer is hiding in our deepest minds"
4079,"Amazing Film on the TV!; This is, so far, the most entertaining film I've ever seen. YOu can't get bored because gags pop up on your screen at any moment. And the only storyline that goes along the whole movie (the B-film Amazon Women on the Moon inside the film) is as hilarious as the rest of the stories. Don't miss the opportunity to watch this movie if it's on your local cable or local video store. You'll be surprised to see the bunch of actors casted here, from Arsenio Hall to Joe Pantoliano, Rosanna Arquette to Michelle Pfeiffer... As the opening credits say: ""Lots of actors"", instead of everybody's name. Sure this is a movie for SNL fans. Who's your favorite SNL star you would like to work in this movie? Will Ferrel, I guess... Grab your popcorn, don't get choke on the laughs... Enjoy!"
31610,"Confusing and slow.....; I am a huge Ziyi Zhang fan and will go to any film to see her which is what took me to Purple Butterfly. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I have to agree with many others who have commented on it. It is very confusing and also extremely slow. Because all of the film appears to have been shot with a hand held camera, significant portions of it are out of focus. The film has very little dialog and what there is doesn't tell you much. There are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation. The way the film time shifts is also very confusing and hard to follow. Even having read a number of reviews beforehand and having a general idea what the film was about, I still had a difficult time understanding what was going on. I knew beforehand that the movie was not remotely similar to previous Ziyi Zhang starring films but was looking forward to seeing her in something different but unfortunately I was ultimately disappointed. She never smiles in this film although admittedly most of the time she doesn't have anything to smile about. I could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants as you could hope to find."
164735,"Cheetah Girls-Excellent Film for young girls; I think that this was an excellent film and that mostly girls up to age 12 or 13 would like this movie. I was 13 when I saw it and I just love the music! The movie was very nice and cute, but it's true, some of the things in it were unrealistic. The electricity being shut down for some stupid dog? That is definitely impossible, especially when you are living in a busy place like NYC! Major acting chops for Raven, Adrienne Bailon, and Sabrina Bryan! I don't think Kiely Williams was that great because she is the only character in which we didn't get to really see her family and her true personality. I'd rate this movie 8 out of 10!"
1380,"Excellent; This is the most excellent movie/musical who ever has been made. Even if its 26 years old, its still VERY good. The actors and actresses is very good, and the music too. I don't think this movie ever gonna get out of time.. I LOVE this movie, it's the best ever. Nearly everyone can look at this film and like it--.--.-.- So if you haven't seen it yet; DO IT! It's really excellent, both funny and well made.., John Travolta and Olivia NEwton-John is really capable in this movie, REALLY! And the people who plays the minor parts too.. Well, don't think I had more to tell ya., The movie can speak itself. You can really imagine how it was went to highschool in the seventies.."
26606,"Quite Disappointing, Contrary to Other Reviews; This film may have been the biggest let-down I've experienced in renting movies based on IMDb reviews. Overall, I simply found this to be a second-rate movie. Leslie Cheung is certainly passable as the antihero and Ma Wu handles his character with cheerful competence. On the other hand, Ma Wu's makeup (facial hair) is so obviously phony that I simply could not take him seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for Halloween, complete with the $4.95 stick-on beard. The special effects were so-so, though the ""undead"" in the cellar were pretty good. The tree-tongue looked like something from a bad 1950s monster flick, though the POV shots from the tongue's view more closely resembled Sam Raimi's trademark shots in the more recent ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. The pyrotechnics were ho-hum and the final battle is about as dull as you can get. (In fact, it most closely reminded me of the ""Lost in Space"" episode where the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and....) The plot was not particularly original and has been told countless times in the form of European fairy tales. There was no suspense and no plot twists. In fact, you know right away as you are introduced to the characters who is good, who is bad, and who is going to survive. I just returned this film to Netflix and then I sat down to write this review. The very first thing I did was check the production date. Yep, it says 1987...not the 1967 that I thought it might be. And that pretty much sums it up: The production values and FX are typical of the 1960s. The plot and action seem much older, as Hollywood was actually producing some interesting and challenging films in the 60s. ** out of *****"
1323,"Awful haunted house thriller/horror.; It's a dark, cold and windy night in Amityville. A car pulls up along side the now notorious 'Amityville House'. Two journalists named John Baxter (Tony Roberts) and Melanie (Candy Clarke) who work for 'Reveal Magazine' get out and enter the house. They are there to expose a psychic scam run by Harold Caswell (John Beal) and his wife Emma (Leora Dana) and write about them in the magazine. John and Melanie's plan of entrapment works and they get their story. The next day John and Melanie go back to the house to take some more photographs for the story. The house's current owner Clifford Sanders (John Harkins) turns up and denies any knowledge of what the Caswell's, the previous tenants were doing. Sanders tells John that he cannot sell the property because of the rumours and stigma attached to it. As John is currently going through a messy divorce with his wife Nancy (Tess Harper) he becomes interested in the property and agrees to buy it when he learns Sanders is, and I quote ""practically giving it away"". Despite Sanders suddenly dropping dead for no real reason John moves in. At first everything seems fine, both he and daughter, Susan (Lori Loughlin) are pleased with the purchase. Things don't stay that way for long, however. Strange things start to happen, doors shut and lock by themselves, lights suddenly switch off for no apparent reason and two tragic 'accidents' happen that take the life of two people who recently had been in the house. John decides to enlist the help of his friend Dr. Elliot West (Robert Joy) who works for the institute of psychic research at the State University, Long Island. West and his team of assistants set lots of scientific equipment up in the house and wait. Eventually they find what they've been searching for, potentially with tragic and explosive consequences! Directed by Richard Fleischer I don't really have anything good to say about this film. The script by David Ambrose and William Wales is about as slow and dull as you could possibly imagine, and every single haunted house cliché is in here somewhere, I mean lights switching themselves on and off? Doors closing on their own? A tap running on it's own? Various 'spooky' noises that turn out to be nothing more than people walking around on creaking floorboards? One character having a very bad feeling about the place but no one else believing them? A innocent séance that turns nasty? Got the general idea yet? The film plods along at a extremely sedate pace until I was almost woken up by a car crash and someone being burned alive inside the wreck, but this sequence only lasts for a couple of minutes and in no way compensates for what has gone before or indeed after. There is a silly rubber monster at the end which is on screen for about half a minute, thanks a lot Fleischer. There is no blood or gore in it, again thanks for nothing Fleischer. There are a couple of unintentionally funny scenes though. At one point Baxter is in a lift that goes out of control. The G-Force on the way up pins him to the floor and on the way back down it pins him to the roof! A very stupid looking scene. As is the one where Sanders is attacked by flies, flies are just not scary or dangerous and all they do is just sort of land on him as Harkins tries to act like he's terrified and that's it, funny stuff. This film was originally shot in 3-D, there are a few scenes here and there which are obviously meant to incorporate this process and stick out like a sore thumb like the pipe through the car window, various things being supernaturally thrown towards the camera and the opening credits which look awful when played flat on an ordinary T.V. screen. It's certainly well made and the acting is OK, look out for Meg Ryan who has a small role as Lisa, one of Susan's friends. Boring, far too long, dull and there isn't a single original idea in the whole thing. I suggest you look elsewhere for some haunted house thrills and chills!"
4689,"The least of Argento's early works; THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto a Nove Code) Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Cromoscope) Sound format: Mono (35mm and 70mm release prints) A blind ex-journalist (Karl Malden) overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of murders at the lab, unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer. Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a giallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner, toplining celebrated Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance in PATTON (1969) - and rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than ""Bird"" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption. Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which Argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart Franco Fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil. It's no surprise that ""Cat"" failed to emulate the runaway success of ""Bird"" when released in 1971. (English version)"
30822,"""In Good Company"" is a great movie; ""In Good Company"" is a sweet comedy that will make you miss your Dad. But, it's not all girlie - it's a good mix comedy with light drama. Topher Grace plays a quirky corporate go-getter that is not too far off-base from anyone who is ambitious in their career and Dennis Quaid plays the role of a middle-aged guy who is conflicted between kissing the boss's butt and just really being annoyed by him all at once. Both are phenomenal actors and this movie is easily one of my new favorites so go watch it! It almost seems like a cookie-cutter design for a movie that just sort of missed the intended mold. It was very suburban and movie-like normal, but with a heavy dose of reality in it. Oh, and without giving away too much, I will say that it does not end the way one expects it to but, I won't explain how. Like I said, it's worth it - go watch this movie!!"
1623,"For 'Fangoria' readers only; WISHMASTER Aspect ratio: 1.85:1 Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS Aimed directly at the 'Fangoria' crowd, though not much fun for anyone else, WISHMASTER is 'presented' by executive producer Wes Craven and directed by makeup maestro Robert Kurtzman, so it's no surprise the movie emphasizes makeup and visual effects at the expense of plot and characterization. The story revolves around an ancient djinn (Andrew Divoff), trapped in an emerald for centuries and accidentally released in modern day America, whereupon it takes human form and grants various characters a series of 'wishes', all of which backfire in gruesome fashion (and I *do* mean gruesome!). For no discernible reason, the monster targets gem specialist Tammy Lauren whose three wishes can release the djinn's evil minions from the Other Side. Naturally, she resists... Stuffed full of 'Fangoria'-friendly cameos (Robert Englund, Tony Todd, Kane Hodder, Ted Raimi, Reggie Bannister, Angus Scrimm, etc.) and visual references to earlier, better pictures (HELLRAISER, THE THING, countless others), the movie has the same kind of bland, homogenized script and production design which afflicts many similar movies from the same period, and the results couldn't be less appealing. Content to showcase a series of grisly set-pieces - most of which, admittedly, are ingeniously designed and presented - the movie hasn't an ounce of depth. Lauren carries the picture with her gutsy performance as the imperilled heroine, and Kurtzman orchestrates the mayhem with enough flash-bang-wallop to hide the scenario's shortcomings, but the story is worthless, despite a smart climactic twist. Three sequels followed - beginning with WISHMASTER 2: EVIL NEVER DIES (1999) - all of which debuted on home video."
5293,"Good Thriller; An original story, that escalates minor events into all out war between two fairly ordinary but stressed out individuals. A simple road accident, leads to 'Jackson' losing his last chance with his kids because 'Afleck' didn't give him a lift. And so it begins, a winding thriller of morality and revenge. 'Tit for Tat' rapidly becomes far more than just childish games, and the lives of everyone involved are turned upside down Very well cast and directed, this is a fine film, with an interesting story. 8/10"
31221,"Elektra movie not that bad; I went to a sneak preview of this movie and when I came out, most of the people I spoke to enjoyed the movie. I was quite surprised to learn that it was being rated and criticized so badly. There are a lot of really bad movies out there rated higher than this one. It was nice to see a female action hero on the screen. One of the things I liked most was the fact that here was this woman kicking butt as an assassin, and selling it. I am sure anyone meeting up with Jennifer Garner in a dark alley would be in for a big surprise. I don't know, maybe expectations were very high? I went in expecting it to be an OK action/popcorn movie - and I think it was. If you have that expectation, I am sure you will enjoy it."
7982,"See this masterpiece before Hollywood destroys it.; The recent history of Hollywood remakes of ghost/horror films from the East has been dismal. This film will inevitably suffer the same fate, so get a copy on e-bay or similar. It is well photographed and the sound is superb. Viewing on a good screen and with a good 5.1 or DTS enabled sound system is recommended. Obviously it is subtitled, so if that puts you off, then I wouldn't bother with this. Dubbing rarely works and simply would not do here. It is also genuinely frightening, with excellent performances from a cast who will be unfamiliar to Western audiences. I would particularly single out the stepmother character, who was utterly brilliant. The ending will have you wanting to watch it again, if you can cope. The plot is relentless, and offers no comforting moments of release along the way. If I do have a small criticism, there is perhaps a detectable influence in certain scenes from the Japanese version of The Ring. We have, however, accepted straight copies of other peoples' ideas for Western films for years, and so my point is a limited one which did not prevent me from giving it 10/10. I believe most fans of this genre will derive huge ""pleasure"" from this film which I for one hope goes down as a classic."
30707,"The world of female boxing in all its glory; This is the tale of a white trailer trash female boxer. She starts getting professional training from ""the best cut man"" in the business late on in life, but proves to be a natural and has a knockout punch. She gets her chance at a title shot but is crippled by an after the bell punch, by the reigning champ and is paralysed. She loses a leg and then asks her trainer to end her life. This is boxing as it is at the grass roots. There is strong characterisation throughout and we get to know the three leads very well. Swank, Eastwood and Freeman are outstanding. This is going to be a film that walks away with awards and deservedly so. This is based on a story by someone who was involved in boxing and this background knowledge shows through. The story is told in a very real way and all of the characters come across with all their faults."
42856,"Not your mainstream horror film... or a horror film in general for that matter; As far as being a horror movie goes, this movie leaves much to be desired. More of an atmospheric thriller than a horror movie per say, Korei is The Sixth Sense, minus the scary scenes. As in accordance with modern Japanese horror movies, Korei relies mostly on increasing psychological intensity rather than the Hollywoodized method of striking visual effects in order to achieve its chills. In this movie, you don't see any gore, or anything ""scary"" in that sense, but there is the constant pervading feeling of dread... which does keep the audience hooked. It's oftentimes reminiscent of Cure, with just as slow a plot. The storyline is well developed and you can't help but feel sorry for the characters. Engaging and provocative, if you're into Japanese horror movies I'd suggest giving this one a try. If you're new to the genre, go watch Ringu instead. Overall, a good film... just not a good horror movie. 6/10"
8970,"The enchantment truly flies!; Choosing which movie to see among the duds these days can be quite difficult. I don't think I could have made a better pick than this one. What a truly magical, enchanting, passionate, and inspiring film this is. Having felt creatively drained of late; this was the perfect way to ""recharge my battery."" I am always amazed to find that artists I think of as genius often go through the same frustrations and need for inspiration as I do . I recommend this film for anyone who needs a catalyst for their imaginations to fly. I also recommend it for anyone who wonders why their childlike wonder, spirit, and eyes are so important to be in touch with. This is when we are in touch with our true selves, and make the biggest, most remarkably unique difference. It is how we heal the wounds of a ""grown up"" world. The acting is superb, as we've come to expect from Johnny Depp. But it's Freddie Highmore, who plays young Peter, Barrie's inspiration, that really stands out. Expect to see more of this kid!"
27170,"OK, watch it if you have too.; There's no single reason why this film is so bad. The basic idea seems OK, A Murderer is killing all the teenage virgins, so all the teenagers decide to have a virginity losing party (a bit stupid but could have been a good laugh) sadly it isn't, It takes itself far too seriously for a plot as ridiculous as this one. The rear of the DVD Cover reviews it as American Pie Meets Scream, this could not be further from the truth, both the aforementioned movies are both Fresh and well made. Cherry Falls simply is neither and the twist at the end is telegraphed so obviously you would have to be dead to not see it coming. There is a little entertainment value to this film, it is certainly not the worst movie of its kind, but if you want a good Teen Horror, go for Scream, I know what you did last Summer, Wrong turn, Jeepers Creepers or even Cabin Fever. A Lame 4/10"
4180,"Not quite as trashy or sensational as I expected.; I found this film to be rather boring, though the shower scenes livened things up a bit. A few general comments: Linda Carol actually did a fair job in the lead role, though her lack of experience was pretty obvious. At least she was the only one who wasn't chewing the scenery. Was she really 16? Seems to me that she was a bit young to be making exploitation films like this. She certainly had the body for it, though. Wendy O. Williams is just sad in her role. As someone who actually saw the Plasmatics play and who still has three of their vinyl LPs, I can't help but wonder where she went wrong in her career. I believe that she was 37 when this film was made, but she looks like she is in her late-40s. Totally inappropriate casting. Plus, her accent/dialect/speech mannerisms are possibly more irritating than Fran Drescher's. On the other hand, I have to give her an A- for keeping in shape like she did. It's a shame that she ended up taking her own life, but there was always that underlying impression of her that told you she had been seriously damaged during her life. You may also think that you will get to see some of Sybil Danning's assets, but, sadly, this is not the case. In fact, unless you have a uniform fetish, Danning is about as close to gender-neutral in this movie as you can get. Even Pat Ast exhibits some sexuality in this move...but not Sybil. Finally, I was prepared for a little more skin than the movie actually showed. Based on other comments, it sounded as if the movie was 40% shower scenes. In reality, though the ""girls"" are pretty skimpily clad throughout the movie, the actual nude scenes are quite brief. Now, I'm not saying that the movie would have been better or worse with more nudity, but that I expected more based on what others had written. I think you actually get more nudity in ""Starship Troopers"". Overall, this was an interesting movie and I was able to watch it all the way through, so I give it ** out of *****. With a few funnier scenes, it might have made it half a star higher."
31225,"good! excellent!; This movie is not just your average movie. It sends out a very powerful message to everyone out there. It particularly applies to the growing minorities. The message was to look at the quality of life and standard of living that our parents have and to ask ourselves if that is the kind of life that we want for ourselves or do we want to do better in life. This movie goes way beyond the scenes of high school life and it has to do with not being inferior and having desire to persevere in life. The question is do we want to be average or do we want better for ourselves. Going to college will not only enhance our chances of being better educated, but it will also enable us to have the ability of having a higher standard of living. Without an education, there is very little that we can accomplish in life and we are nothing without it."
27822,"Brief Review; Open Water; I recently viewed the movie, ""Open Water"". I disagree in part with the comments of ""Movie 1021"". The only comparison between this movie and ""Jaws"" is the ocean. To bring the sharks into the review, likening the movie in any way with ""Jaws"" would be like reviewing ""Casablanca"" as ""just like Open Waters"" because the two main characters are a man and a woman. This movie, ""Open Waters"" is said to be based upon actual events, much like the movie ""Perfect Storm"". As with ""Perfect Storm"", the screen writer could only guess at the interaction between the two main characters during their disastrous ordeal. I found this interaction extremely believable, especially the argumentation sequence which showed the viewer that the writer and director understand human nature to a special degree. The vast majority would respond in kind if placed with a loved one in such a situation. Blame must be established in the frustrated, exhausted mind and finger pointing is imminent even between those most loved. In ""Jaws"" the focus was on the shark...which actually leaves its own environment, thrashing onto the boat, the haunt of man, to destroy him with almost human passion and vengeance. In ""Open Waters"" the two humans found themselves in the habitat of the shark which simply followed its biological norm and fed upon that provided by the ocean. In my opinion, ""Open Waters"" is an excellent study of human nature, not the nature of the shark. The writer, it seems to me, was expressing the reaction of human nature to a situation totally foreign to it, while the sharks reacted to the situation exactly as their nature dictated in a situation completely common to it. I enjoyed this 'study' very much and would recommend the movie to any who ask me. J. Ira Monroe"
82698,"Oh really...; Man, i remember this movie. when I was little I use 2 always watch this. I use 2 be scared of it 2, but now that its 2005, the movie is so cheesy now. Demonic Toys, Wax Works and all of the Puppet Masters are so lame now. Even though years before I was terrified!!!! It's really weird 2 look back on all the things that scared u when u were younger, and look at them now. All I can do is laugh at this corny crap! It's just so weird. It was around the time that killer dolls were frighting. But Chucky is still watchable. He's still somewhat creepy I guess, but now it's nothing but good old humor!! I do however suggest that u rent this film or even buy it if u want 2 watch a comedy. It should be fun 2 sit around with friends and laugh at this movie. Besides that the plot was awful and the effects were useless, u could find something good about it if u look hard enough. But me? Absolutely not, I still can't believe this use 2 give me goose bumps!"
3380,"Noir  ""procedural"" takes the cake; A nice moment between John Ireland and Wilma, his boss' mistress. She teases him with a nickname, and he answers ""The name is Duke."" She jokes ""You petrify me!"" A quip that is a nod to Bogey's Duke Mantee character in ""Petrified Forest,"" but Ireland's Duke is relatively without Mantee's charm, he is definitely not go to fall in love with the leading lady, or do her any favors. He is only looking out for his own hide. And brutally so, even while perfuming his ammunition. Keeping his lascivious eye on Ryan's sister while pretending to help her with her brother's case, he is always a leering physical threat to her. Fine noir ingredients include dark streets and dangerous shadows. Much camera movement and interesting closeups keep up the pace. Watch Turner Classic for future airings."
1676,"Not sure why so many consider this a B movie.; Several reviewers have relegated this to B movie status, which is beyond my understanding. The cast is fine, the FX are well above average, and the movie is reasonably well-paced. Plus, it feels free to kill off any character at any time...one of my favorite qualities of adventure and horror movies. The thing about this film that is hardest for me to swallow, though, is the complete lack of respect for the original novel. I believe that Verhoeven stated once that he read only a portion of the book because he got bored, or for some similar reason. That's a shame. The novel is actually an interesting discussion of social and political structures, much of it couched in the classic ""dialogue"" format employed by Socrates and the other great ancient philosophers. This aspect is completely absent from the movie. Overall, a good adventure movie with some wild FX and pretty good sound. I give this a **** out of *****."
8951,"Excellent but disappointing; Vera Drake was something of a disappointment for me. Review after review hails the movie as some extraordinary catharsis. I disagree. It is hard to say why. Visually, it is stunning: heads lit from above by dim bulbs as they were in the era, shadows at once soft and dangerous. Staunton gives an amazing performance, but I will credit Leigh for insightful casting. She is a cheerfully non-descript person engaging in dangerous, medical emergencies - some call murder - in a cheerfully non-descript way. The build-up to her eventual arrest is overlong, stuffed with a pair of subplots that almost, but not quite, tie seamlessly into Vera's own story. The pacing is slow without being mesmerizing like Paris, Texas, or hypnotic, like Lost in Translation. It is worth watching for the performances, all around amazing, and the colors so saturated you could eat them."
3739,"A Terrific Sophisticated Comedy With a Terrific Sophisticated Cast!; To heap more phrase on this film seems somewhat superfluous in light of the previous viewer comments...but I just can't resist!  I saw this film for the first time this past May, thanks to TCM.  I have not been able to stop watching it since.  It's such a pleasure to see a film where the special effects do not become the entire reason for its existence.  The dialogue is snappy and fast, like a back-and-forth tennis volley, with a bite and a sharpness sadly lacking in today's movies.  The cast is superb.  Kay Francis is typical Kay Francis, with an understated sadness about her.  Miriam Hopkins is terrific, both sharp and ""perky"" (usually I hate that word, but it does describe her here!).  And Herbert Marshall is simply superb...both suave and enjoyable.  The essence of a great cast, to me, has always been an ability by the actors to make you really believe that they are who they are playing - a task which everyone here accomplishes!  Again, it's just such a pleasure to see a film that doesn't insult one's intelligence, that doesn't play only for the suburban teenager or the lowest common denominator moviewatcher.         A test for me has always been whether I leave a film wishing there was more.  Well, two minutes after seeing ""Trouble,"" I found myself wishing that there had been a sequel, showing Gaston's and Lily's adventures on, say, an early 1930's transatlantic crossing.  Oh well.  I hope that the forthcoming DVD version does justice to this great comedy.  If you like movies, intelligent movies, with a slyness, please see this film.  And the last scene of ""Trouble in Paradise"" has become one of my very favorite endings in cinema!!"
8366,"You don't have to be down with G-O-D to know Saved is hilarious!; Saved! is a movie that will get to the hearts of people everywhere. It so poignantly captures the hardships and comedies of being a teenage girl. Jena Malone is Mary, a typical teen attending a Christian school. After finding out her boyfriend is gay, a vision of Jesus provokes her to ""cure"" him by sleeping with him. But when Christian Mary finds out that she is pregnant, all hell breaks loose! She tries to hide the pregnancy, but it becomes difficult. Mary is shunned by her outgoing and devoutly Christian friend Hilary Faye (Mandy Moore), and finds solace with the uniquely rebellious Cassandra (Eva Amurri), who also happens to be the only Jew in the school. Mary also finds a friend in Patrick (Patrick Fugit), the pastor's son. Mary puts up with a lot from Hilary Faye and her friends trying to save her- even the pastor gets involved: ""I want you to help"" ... ""You mean shoot her?"" ""No... I was thinking something a little less 'gangsta'"". But when Hilary Faye goes too far, Cassandra, Mary, Patrick, and Hilary Faye's cool but wheelchair-bound brother Roland (Macaulay Culkin) team up to let Hilary Faye know that she can be ""down with G-O-D"", but has to be understanding of others as well. The movie is full of hilarious lines and activities, but it remains believable. Malone portrays a typical teenager who is just trying to fit in and have fun despite her differences. Parts of the movie had me cracking up and quoting it for days on end, other parts were tear-provokingly sweet. As a whole, Saved! is one movie that you can't afford to miss. It just may save us all."
5810,"This is so real!; This movie is so real. The film showed exactly how the streets of Detroit look. Being that i was born and raised in Detroit, i know exactly ho things are. I was proud of the director (Curtis Hanson) for actually going 2 Detroit 2 shoot the film. He could went 2 LA and called it a day, but that would have taken all of the realistic values. He stuck 2 scene and showed the rest of the world what Detroit is like. People down Detroit all the time. It's really not that bad. But Eminem did an excellent job playing Jimmy. You find a lot of men in Detroit that has the same back ground as his character. Eminem told a similar story of his own. He's a white male from Detroit that always dreamed of becoming a rapper. This movie was nothing but non-stop drama and that's what I loved about it mainly. It had it's humor, it had it's fun, it has all of the qualities of a good film. I suggest that anyone who hasn't it 2 either rent it or purchase it, u won't regret it."
87884,Helen Mirren's unforgettable staircase scene; I remember seeing this in theaters in the early seventies ( it never seems to be on television nor is it available on DVD). The two scenes I remember best were Dorothy Ttin savagely cutting up vegetables and Helen Mirren's Gosh Boyle descending the staircase nude in all her youthful and voluptuous glory. What a memorable moment. The rest of the film seemed to be about this modern sculptor/welder/whatever who had the typical artistic characteristics of ego and insensitivity. I remember that Helen Mirren's character was not exactly admirable but she was so stunning in that staircase scene that I did not care. Mirren has since ( and before in Age of Consent) done some great nude or semi-nude scenes but this is the one she will be remembered for.
8977,"Worst  Movie   Ever; Ya know how some movies are so bad they're funny? And how some movies are so bad you feel embarrassed for the actors? Well, this movie was neither. It was so bad it was just, well, bad. And I mean B-A-D. I have no idea why we didn't walk out. I think Colin Farrell's idea of acting is just opening his eyes VERY WIDE to look: surprised, angry, sad, annoyed, happy, whatever. I thought in the beginning when they introduced Old Ptolemy, ""Oh man, this movie was so bad they couldn't even get Anthony Hopkins to play Ptolemy. Where did they find such a bad Anthony Hopkins impersonator?"" How disappointed I was when the credits rolled. -7/10"
30749,"Shocking, haunting, and real; I am sure that my general reaction is like most reviewers -- a remarkable film about a horrific episode in human history brought to life in a most intense and rewarding experience -- but I thought I'd approach it a little differently. We saw Hotel Rwanda in the theater on Saturday night and rented Gandhi on Sunday night, so for better or worse, the film drew comparisons with a multi-Oscar ""best picture,"" ""best actor"" extravaganza. And it fared well... The plot and character similarities are striking. Both movies center around non-western men of color who have absorbed Western values (or at least the values the West pays lip service to) and ways of life, only to find them entirely lacking when they are most needed. Both men use their Western training to their advantage on their own to accomplish the seemingly impossible. And both men leave behind extraordinary accomplishments, but not unqualified successes -- the problems of the world are bigger than any individuals, even ones with greatness such as these. The backdrops are also similar, though the emphasis is different. Hotel Rwanda focusing on the utter lunacy of internecine conflict, with the cold arrogance of the West as a secondary theme. Gandhi reverses these -- the struggles against Western imperialism is center stage, with Hindu-Muslim hatred (substitute Hutu-Tutsi, Serb-Bosnian, Israeli-Palestinian, Catholic-Protestant in northern Ireland, etc, etc, etc) surfacing only when the oppression of the British is lifted. Somewhat surprisingly, I liked Hotel Rwanda more. Perhaps it is because Paul, Don Cheadle's character, is less God-like and thus more approachable than Ben Kingsley's Gandhi. It could be the difference in history; it could be the screenplays, or it could be that Don Cheadle was so incredibly evocative on the screen. I suffered with him, I commiserated with him, I plotted with him (tho he was ever so much more facile than I), and ultimately I was overwhelmed by his strength and courage because he was not God-like. Paul could have been you or me, but I doubt I could or would have done anything like what he did. And that is what makes this story and this movie's telling of the story all the more special. Finally, there are moral questions galore lurking beneath the surface (another distinction between Hotel Rwanda and Gandhi, where we were always told ""this is what is right""). For instance, Paul gave up several opportunities to do great things for smaller groups of people. Had things turned out differently, his choices would have looked very bad indeed. So, taking away hindsight, were his choices right or wrong? How much does one risk for one's family in order to try to benefit an even greater good? Go see it. Appreciate it. It's special."
2164,"Just don't; This is a total waste of one-plus hours that I will never ever get back. I am considering divorcing my formerly beloved partner, who forced me to watch this. How could she? I thought she loved me. Even though I often love B movies, this one is a mess. Not an entertaining mess, just a mess. Somebody spent more than $100 on this -- there is more than one set, there is a full cast, there are costumes. The shots are generally clean and well set up. There may even be a plot, although it's a bit difficult to tell. But the editing is inexplicable. Troma is usually gloriously B, and full of deliciously unconvincing gore. In this case, they should have saved a couple of gallons of fake blood. Be happy. Live long and prosper. Don't rent this."
65293,"The Maltese Falcon as screwball comedy; If you can get past the fact that this is not another version of the much-loved noir classic and take it on its own terms, this film actually has a lot going for it. If you want emotional depth, look elsewhere. Here, murder, betrayal, infidelity and the mindless destruction of gorgeous deco furniture are routinely shrugged off as minor inconveniences. The film is briskly paced and full of snappy dialog. The characters are broadly drawn and fun to watch. The acting is -- well, not full of subtle nuance but certainly appropriate to the piece. The script is by Brown Holmes, who is also credited with the original 1931 version (which I have not seen but would love to; Dwight Frye as Wilmer -- wow!). William Warren carries the film as the confident, always one-jump-ahead Ted Shayne (and looks appropriately satanic). Bette Davis gives as good as she gets, even managing to thwart Shayne of the reward for her capture. Marie Wilson is a treasure as the ditsy Miss (Effie?) Murgatroyd, who apparently has trouble spelling her own last name but still has a lot on the ball. Alison Skipworth is fun as a female Gutman, Arthur Treacher has Peter Lorre's rather superfluous role (without the innuendos), and Maynard Holmes is the creepy gunsel who can't seem to hold onto his gun. The cops are, of course, suitably dense. If you enjoy colorful characters exchanging breezy chatter and cracking wise, you could do worse. Give it a chance the next time it's on TCM. If you don't like it, you can always change the channel. (PS: The plot summary as given by the IMDb is incorrect. Shayne doesn't meet Valerie on a train, she doesn't hire him to find Barabbas, Barabbas doesn't ask him to find Valerie, and the ram's horn is not covered with precious jewels. Other than that, it's spot on.)"
30707,"Million Dollar Disappointment; Clint is overrated as an actor, and as a director, and compose (ad nauseaum). What starts off as modestly interesting film veers way-off-course into 'Whose Life Is It Anyway?"" territory. Hilary is appealing, but another Oscar? NO. Morgan's character (the narrator) is blind out of one eye in some scenes and sees clearly out of both eyes in others. The character of Danger ranks up there w/ Jar Jar Bling (from Phantom Menace) for 'most annoying.' As a stunt-person, my attraction to the film were the boxing scenes, and they're well choreographed, but the meteoric rise Hilary's character achieves is not very plausible. Too bad Clint choose to make her family members into evil, cartoon caricatures. Overall: B-."
3265,"Yes yes yes yes!; I saw this film shortly after i saw John Woo's 'The Killer'and all of his other bloodshed movies thinking nothing could ever top 'killer'. Then i notice this on the shelf in HMV and could not believe i had not seen it yet, i go home i watch it and oh my god! is this the most violent and coolest movie ever made or what!i mean the scenes at the hospital towards the end and the warehouse scene where Chow Yun- Fat comes down on the skylight and all the guys on the motorbikes come in! those have to be the greatest action shoot em up moments ever put on screen. This has to be Woo's finest work to date, i also heard this was his last film in china before going of to America. Well thank god Woo and Chow left their 'De Niro and Scorsese' relationship with something as beautiful as this. An easy 11 out of 10!!! shame Hard Boiled 2 did not work out so well!"
65293,"Great Classic Talent !; Just happened to view this film from the 1930's which I seemed to have missed with Bette Davis and many great character actors. It is something like the ""Maltese Falcon"", where everyone is involved with trying to find a TRUMPET filled with valuable gems. Bette Davis,(Valerie Purvis),""Madame Sin"",'72, looks very young and attractive and lives up to her role as an evil lady who stops at nothing to charm her men and use them in every way possible and of course, sexually! Warren William, (Ted Shayne),""The Wolf Man"",'41, looks like John Barrymore and even Basil Rathbone,(Sherlock Holmes series of the 1940's), Ted Shayne manages to take on the case of trying to find the valuable TRUMPET and has a dippy female assistant, Marie Wilson,(Miss Murgatroyd),""Waterfront"", who has a crush on her boss Ted Shayne who simply goes head over heels for Valerie, who wraps him around her pinkie. Arthur Treacher,(Anthony Travers),""Mary Poppins"",'64, famous for his, ""Arthur Treacher Fish & Chips Food Chain years ago. Anthony Travers gives a great supporting role and always looks like the butler he use to play in most of his films. If you love Classic films with Bette Davis, this is definitely the film for you."
2125,"Somethings incorrect.; This is my all time favorite movie I have probably seen it a thousand or more times. I have noticed though that they edited it incorrectly. If you pay close attention to the part where Danielle is flying the kite and Henry rides up and talks to Gustave she lets go of the kite. Now you would think that Maurice would find the kite after she let it go not before she even was flying it.Although this is a wonderful fairy tale and one Adult ""kids"" can enjoy I feel as if I am being taken back to a different place and time with out the massive our human family faces today.I do believe though the end of the movie was the best, where the so called evil step-mother gets her just desserts.I bet there are a lot of people out there that feel like Danielle did before she married the Prince. I know I once did. This is a great movie for people of all ages."
3197,"Brilliant; An amazing movie. All the elements come together to make a very entertaining movie that gets better the more you watch it. From Bruce Broughton's masterful score (one of his very best in my view) to Peter Hyams' evocative photography, everything comes in focus around a first-class cast that include star-making performances by Mark Harmon and Meg Ryan and the wonderful turns we take all too easily for granted by Sean Connery and Jack Warden. The chase sequences are among the most inventive and gripping of modern cinema and are edited with just the right touch (take note you commercial directors who think chase scenes consist of unwatchable snippets of film) and highlight a great story full of lively characters. Overall, a very memorable movie, which helps explain why it keeps showing up again and again on our TVs."
33587,"Stella; This film had been shown several times in local retrospectives, but unfortunately, we never caught up with it. Finally, TCM showed it recently and we have to thank them for a great movie that will sure entertain as well as disturb the viewer willing to take the ride! Under the experienced direction of Lewis Allen, this 1944 gem of a film, based on the fine novel by Dorothy Macardle, is shown in all its splendor. Roderick and Pamela Fitzgerald, brother and sister, living on a meager existence in London are lucky enough to find a great house on the coast overlooking a fantastic scenery. What's more, the house is a bargain they can't pass! It needs some cleaning, and painting, but it's almost ready to be inhabited by the Fitzgerald. The only problem is the property is haunted. The Fitzgeralds buy the house from a rather odd man, Commander Beech, who appears to be local gentry who has been connected to the property. He has a young and beautiful granddaughter, Stella Meredith, who is forbidden to go visit the newly arrived Londoners, but there's an immediate attraction between her and Roderick, as well as a budding friendship with Pamela, the kind sister. The Fitzgeralds get much more of what they bargained for. The ghost of the past makes an appearance as the new owners feel its presence right away.. Sobbbing can be heard, as well as a strong smell of mimosas permeates everything whenever the specter is felt in the mansion. The Fitzgeralds want an explanation from the Commander, but he's not willing to even consider returning the money. What to do? The great asset of this picture is the enormously talented cast. Under the direction of Lewis Allen, they give life to all the characters one sees on the screen. It helps to have secured the services of a charismatic Ray Milland who gives one of his best performances. The hugely talented Ruth Hussey is equally fine in her portrayal of Pamela Fitzgerald. Donald Crisp, as the mysterious Commander Beech makes the character more intriguing than what he is. One of the great surprises of the film is Gail Russell, the gorgeous actress, seen at her best. She makes a great Stella, equally fragile, as well as questioning the mystery surrounding her past. This also was a rare occasion for watching one of the pillars of the American theater, Cornelia Otis Skinner who makes a great Miss Holloway. This is a picture that is enhanced by the many contributors that made the film so great to watch. The impressive black and white cinematography of Charles Lang is glorious. In the opening sequence the view of the sea breaking against the rocks looks like a painted seascape. The atmospheric music by Victor Young conveys the mystery that surrounds the whole story. Edith Head's costumes reflect the life of the times. The sets by Stephen Seymour are exquisite to look at. We feel as though we are intruding in the lives of all these characters in the England of the 40s. Excellent film. It won't disappoint!"
8960,"Definitely a must-see, especially if you have relatives stationed in Iraq; I saw this, but I think the best commentary is from my son - who is currently stationed in Iraq. He'll be home soon - he's been there for over a year. I got this e-mail from him today: ----Original E-mail Message---- We have done so much good over here, but it is time for a break. I would like it if everyone could find a copy of a movie called ""Voices of Iraq"" and watch it and then pass it on to a friend and let them watch. ""Voices of Iraq"" is shot by the Iraqi people of the Iraqi people and allows you to hear how they feel about the war in Iraq. It was shot between MAR 04 and OCT 04 which is when we were doing most of our operations. I have been to several of the places in Baghdad where parts of the film were shot. It gave even me a new outlook at some of the stuff happening over here and I have been living it for the past 13 months. Please check out this video and let your friends know to watch it, particularly the ones who say we shouldn't have come over here or that we should leave now. Well I better get back to work. Hope to see you all soon. Frank Novak SSG, USA --------------------- P.S. from armymom - he'll be going back again within the year, and my one nephew has been there and returned, and my other nephew is currently also over there. And yes, we support what they are doing, and their Commander-in-Chief."
91709,"Startlingly Raw But At Core A Bit Prosaic; Walter Huston plays the brutal figure who lives in Africa in a wheelchair and orders everyone around. He seems to have a sexual relationship with Lupe Velez, misused by the script and director as she so often was. The movie's attitude toward natives of the area -- known, as they were for decades in adventure movies just as natives -- is insulting but of its time. I am writing on Martin Luther King Day; so it does seem a bit ironic. The Huston character's primary goal in life is revenge against the man who put him in the wheelchair and this he plots through debasement of the man's daughter. Virginia Bruce, whom we first meet in a convent school, is very convincing as the slatternly alcoholic he turns her into. She is rescued by a drug-addicted doctor who happens into the area -- this is sort of a ""Petrified Forest,"" African style. Huston discovers that she is actually his own daughter and this changes him entirely and a little implausibly, not to mention in a soap opera-like way. It's a weird and gripping movie, though; make no mistake, and it's definitely worth watching. Huston discovers that she is actually his own daughter and this changes him entirely and a little implausibly, not to mention in a soap opera-like way.

27919,"Michael Moore didn't cause 911; This piece of propaganda has no regard for the truth. There is no limit to the lengths they will go to lead the feeble minded into demonizing Moore. In one instance the show a news article which the say Moore altered for his book, they say when Moore was confronted about the article the his lawyers claimed it was a misprint. The problem is that the said article never appeared in a Michael Moore book as they claim. One of their main 'witnesses' is Dick Morris, a political consultant who was going around claiming then governor Clinton 'beat him up'. Later he helped with Clinton's re-election and was a White House adviser until it was discovered that he was allowing hired girlfriends to listen in on confidential calls to the president."
2944,"The ""bad"" ending?; If you complain about the so-called vicious ending of this movie, do you also abhor all slasher movies and other mindless displays of gore and sex? Civilians die in war. It is not glamorous nor is it pretty but it is a fact. I don't think The Dirty Dozen glamorizes one bit of civilian death. Would you suggest that if we know the exact location of Osama Bin Laden but there are women and children with him, it shouldn't be bombed?? Please. Yeah, maybe the movie makers could have refrained from showing the screaming women being doused with gasoline. Whatever. Had the mission been to just bomb the château, many more civilians would certainly have died. What's the difference? All in all, this is an OK film with some interesting characters and situations."
4262,"Pure Filmaking. This is it!; He had accomplished the incredible in 'The Godfather' for such an early role and age,turned into a genius of acting in 'Dog Day Afternoon'and became one of the greatest living actors in the world in 'The Godfather Part 2'. But none of them can even compare to his performance in this absolutely amazing film. I have now seen 'Scarface' 23 time sand can still say it is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. Everything in it is still brilliant Brian De Palma's amazing directions, totally great story from Oliver Stone and without a doubt Pacino's best acting (and he did not get an Oscar why?). The chainsaw scene is even more chilling as it ever was and same as the infamous climax at Tony Montana's mansion at the end with that mother of a gun. A total favourite of mine!"
30707,"Boring; This movie does not connect you to the characters at all, in fact you should doze off and have thoughts about something else several times in the movie. The main things that happen are: Girl wants Eastwood to be her trainer, Eastwood agrees because he is down, girl wins a lot of fights in the 1st round, girl gets seriously injured, family won't support girl (I actually read this, I dozed off at this part because it was so boring), Eastwood pulls plug on girl. Obviously this sucks for the girl, but there is no attachment to her or any of the other characters. The retard character seems to be filler. This movie is long and you should be just waiting for it to end. This is no Mystic River. Zero stars."
4654,"I didn't want to go to the bathroom until I saw the ending.; I had to watch this for work because someone told me that the company I worked for had a song in this film, and wanted to know if the song was cleared for ""road house's"" use. So I sat and watched it. No the song was not in the film. Yes the person who gave me the tip is no longer on my xmas card list. Some movies are bad in a way that allows you to make fun of them. This isn't one of them, and therefore has approximately zero redeeming qualities unless you like being annoyed and wasting your time. On the positive side, maybe the filming of it employed some people so they could put food on their table. I recently saw some grade-school kids at a park filming their use of their toy trucks in a sandbox. That was more interesting than 'road house.' A shame that a somewhat esteemed actor like Gazzara had to stoop to this level but some actors do that sort of thing, like Ray Milland in ""The Thing With Two Heads,"" Beau Bridges in ""Village of the Giants,"" or Glen Campbell and Joe Namath in ""Norwood."""
1408,"Intensely good; Movies that are centered around war often bring blood thirsty men to the box office craving carnage and amputations of all kinds. Well the blood thirsty man will get this when they watch this amazing picture, I know because I happen to be one of those blood thirsty savages, but there is another element that makes this movie so darn good. The romance seen between Hawkeye and Miss Munroe contains enough passion to ignite the forest where their love blooms a blaze. The romance seen in this movie is not the kind that women crave, and men make gagging sounds to, but it is the kind that makes women swoon and guys say, ""This Hawkeye character, he's the man."" This is clearly shown when viewers see Hawkeye vow to rescue Miss Munroe no matter what in the scene that takes place behind the waterfall. This movie deserves a much higher overall rating because it satisfies the male thirst for carnage, and the female thirst for love and romance, but at the same time men that watch this movie see that romance is not always as cheesy as it seems."
66354,"Limited by the staging; This direct to video film is a re-staging of Andrew Lloyd-Webber's second great musical. The word ""re-staging"" is very appropriate here, for the movie is confined to the stage sets and effects. This approach limited the movie impact of some scenes (especially the entry into Jerusalem and Jesus' flogging). The story is that of Jesus' last days as seen (chiefly) through the eyes of Judas Iscariot and Mary Magdalene. It is also, as other reviews have noted, a secularised version of these days. The musical plays up Jesus' hesitation at Gethsemane to the point of suggesting that he no longer had faith in his mission, and plays down the miraculous. It finishes with the crucifixion rather than the resurrection and shows a crowd hungering for healing but no actual healings. In contrast to the 1973 movie version, which was set in Biblical Judea, the setting for this film is a modern fascist/totalitarian state with graffiti and machine guns. While this kind of reimagining has been used successfully to keep other familiar stories fresh, the limitations of the stagy production prevented this version from soaring to the level that might have been expected given the strong musical performances."
82015,"Who's Responsible?; I can't understand someone not understanding this film, or considering it as anything less than masterful. I saw it on the big screen, and it left me, like its more illustrious predecessor, profoundly disturbed. In fact, David Wayne's ""M"" is more frightening than Peter Lorre's--Lorre was a brilliant actor, but his rather idiosyncratic appearance makes it easy to tag him as a ""monster"", and it typecast him as a perverse (and fascinating!) villain for most of his career. David Wayne not only turns in an harrowing and sympathetic (!) performance in this underrated masterpiece, but he does it with a face as bland and Midwestern as Wonder Bread. His casting, and Losey's change of locale and lighting to working class, sun-drenched and sun-faded shots of L.A., make the crimes and the criminal too believable, too naturalistic for comfort. Murder is more frightening in broad daylight than in shadows, where we've been taught to expect it. There are outstanding moments here: Losey's double-coded messages about the female body (the mannequin scene), which--despite lines inserted to please the censors--indicate that sex is behind the child-murders, the incredible hunt in the wonderful Bradbury Building, even a few comedic one liners (when the hapless police force shake up a low-class joint, and they ask the patrons what they're doing in the place, a bum replies, ""Slummin'!"") But it is the conclusion, the gut-wrenching final ""courtroom"" scene with David Wayne giving the most realistic, disturbing and moving portrait of psychopathy on the screen, that cements this film as a classic worthy of standing up to its predecessor. And when his ""lawyer"" questions the mob--and himself, and the viewers--as to who was truly responsible for this man and his evil, the answer is always disturbing. Losey believed that ""it takes a village"" fifty years ago, and his ""M"" remains a brand-hot indictment of a corrupt and money-hungry, perverse and puritanical, escapist and scapegoating society."
26371,"Marlon Brando was Fantastic !; When I first viewed this film I was completely captivated by the great acting of both Jack Nicholson,""The Last Tycoon"",'76 and Marlon Brando, ""Sayonara"",'57. I was completely shocked by the way this picture ended and I always remembered the ending and forgot the entire story. The entire picture starts off weird, where you are seeing a man swinging from a rope around his neck and dying quite slowly. However, this unfortunate guy stole a horse and it was a major offense in the State of Missouri and the story revolves around a gang lead by Jack Nicholson who is burning out from trying to steal horses for a living and decides to send some of his gang into Canada for some fresh horses. Kathleen Floyd(Jane Braxton),""The Car"",'77, who plays a very sexy role and is bold enough to ask Jack Nicholson if he wants sexual intercourse on their second date. Marlon Brando plays the role of a Hawk, who searches out horse thieves and uses every horrible way in order to torture them with a horrible evil deed. I believe Brando put his heart and soul completely into playing this role and it is truly a masterpiece which I will never forget. He is and always will be one of our great Film Actors of all TIME!"
3895,"Weird movie; This is a weird, weird movie. Basically, Keanu Reeves plays a serial killer who becomes so obsessed with James Spader (the FBI agent who is trying to catch Keanu), that Keanu kidnaps Spader's girlfriend, who ends up dying. The killer actually even says that he does this because he thought the FBI guy was spending too much time focusing on her instead of him (!). FBI guy then has a nervous breakdown of some sort, quits the FBI, moves across the country and lives on disability in what is probably the most depressing apartment ever. James Spader really gives this role 110%. He looks like he's in excruciating pain all the time. The killer tries to get on with his life, even trying to form a new ""relationship"" with the new FBI agent assigned to track him down, but it's just not the same. So the killer follows Spader across country and mails him pictures of girls he is going to (and has) killed, in order to coax the former FBI guy back into tracking him. When this fails to get the attention of Spader (he's a total basketcase and doesn't open his mail), the killer SENDS HIM FLOWERS, along with a picture of the girl Keanu is going to kill in 24 hours unless Spader can find her first. This effectively breaks the basketcase away from his new full time job of staring at the walls of his bleak apartment and gets him back in the swing of hunting the killer. Up to this point, the movie is actually really good and engaging. I cared about this broken shell of a man who is trying to recover from his mental breakdown caused by a maniac who refuses (for what appear to be rather taboo reasons) to leave him alone. But about halfway through the film, the movie seemed to just sort of give up and degenerated into a fairly run of the mill cat-and-mouse type thing. Usually, when a movie starts out quirky, it stays quirky. Or if it's going to be mediocre, it starts out that way and doesn't change. This movie could have been something really special if the filmmakers would have had the guts to follow through on the set up and what was REALLY going on between the killer and the FBI guy, instead of just letting the movie devolve into a boring rehash of just about every other cop-chasing-maniacal-killer movie we've ever seen."
8685,"Mr. Fleaberhopper; You call Marcelino Pan y Vino MPV a ""Sick Sick Sick"" flick ? Sounds like you have an ax to grind sir. Why are you so angry?. Heavens !!! It's only a movie !!!! This movie had nothing sick to it. I found it to be clean and heart warming. I have definitely seen really filthy and sick movies before and MPV does not fit the mold. If you don't agree with the contents or the way it was projected, why don't you explain how the movie can be improved or changed or presented. You sound like someone who is angry with the church.....perhaps with Christ ????? Hmmmm ...now who is really the propagandist? I saw this movie when I was a child and it had a positive impact on me. It was magical. I felt the same way as if I had seen Snow White or Sleeping Beauty. The only difference with this one is that I do believe miracles do happen and I believe Marcelino did not hallucinate as he saw Christ descending from the cross. If I did not believe in Christ or was an unbeliever, I would look at this movie as another family fantasy movie but I know I would not call it sick. I detect anger in your criticism and nothing constructive can come out of your opinion sir."
8529,"I haven't seen a movie that I laughed so hard for long time.; One of the best movies that I have seen in recent years. I used to think Tom Honks to be a good actor. After this movie, I upgrade him to be one of the greatest actor in my book. I think this movie is a continuation of the ""cast away"". The theme of that movie was ""fate will bring unite a couple who are meant to be together"". This movie is ""destiny will separate perfect couple"". I'm hoping Steven make another movie in the same theme, and make it a trilogy. In both movies, the main character was put into a strange place. He was force to learn new skills as an adult to support himself. After satisfying physical needs, he searched for love. I can't wait to see the next movie in this series. I can't believe this movie get lower rating than the fake ""hero"". To boost its rating, I gave it a 10. In fairness, I'd have given it a 9.5."
428,"This is it ! my all time number 1 favourite film ever; I have now seen this film about 38 times and i still absolutely adore this instant classic! being a huge De Niro fan and of mafia films too i knew that i would love this and i did. The incredible story by Chazz Palminteri (who also plays Sonny magically in the movie)is great and stays true to it's roots, the tensity shown between the Italian- Americans and the African- Americans and of course the fact that De Niro is in it and It was his first job as director. The Film is about a young boy who grows up in the Bronx streets of New York and after he sees someone killed in front of him by Sonny the 'boss of the neighbourhood' he makes the choice not to tell the police and Sonny immediately takes a liking to the boy. Soon he grows up in to a young man, now with two fathers one his real dad a bus driver (played by Robert De Niro)and the other is Sonny who both tell him which choices he should make in life if he values his future and soon he will find that out the hard way.I myself is still a teenager, but i know what a good film is . This is a perfect film."
30816,"Awesome, awesome movie; This movie totally knocked my socks off. I had never seen the stage production, and wasn't familiar with the plot or anything. But my friend saw it and he was just like, ""You HAVE to see this movie."" And he was right - as soon as we left the theatre, we were both plotting ways to get the rest of our friends to come. (Btw, he saw it five times in a week - slightly obsessed.) If you haven't seen it yet, turn off your computer right now and go. I mean it. I agree vehemently with all the wonderful things everyone's already said about Phantom, and I'm not going to bother repeating them all again now. But there's one thing - everyone keeps saying Gerard Butler can't sing. I disagree. Not to put anyone down, but I heard the Michael Crawford version of Music of the Night yesterday, and I liked Butler's rendition much better. His voice is powerful and deep and dark and sexy and altogether, I thought, more appropriate for the character. And he sings with such INTENSITY and FEELING. True, he is pushing it on some of the really high notes, but he more than makes up for it the other 99% of the time. And sometimes it's better that way - for example, in the All I Ask of You reprise, he's all weak and shaky, but he's crying, so it makes it totally authentic. The Phantom is such a complex character, with such emotional depth, and Butler gets all of that across. He said on TV that he was limited in the acting because of the mask, so he had to convey everything through his voice. He succeeds. Phenomenally."
4223,"top notch war movie; Absolutely top rate production values. Pacing is very good. Characters are pretty good. A mix of Hollywood techniques and European film-making. This gives it a slightly different feel than most Hollywood movies. Sets the scene/background fairly well. And as another reviewer pointed out, although the film take the point of view of the Russians, the movie goes out of its way to denigrate communism sufficiently to please the American neoliberal regime. Heavens knows what would happen these days to a film that actually portrayed socialism from a favorable perspective! I recommend it."
8807,"Cool except for the chicks; Like some others, I agree that this film was not just funny, but displayed real wit. (I even loved the promos in which the actors are referred to as ""the Indian guy from"" movie X and ""the Asian guy from"" movie Y.) The leads are solid actors and they both have strong comedy skills. And yes, like some others, I've had the Ivy League experience and do know folks very like the ones portrayed. But.... My friends and I have a saying about movies or books in which women are people, not eye candy or plot devices -- we call them ""cool on chicks"". H&KG2WC definitely ain't cool on chicks; they exist as -- well, as plot devices. I found it particularly disappointing because I thought the film handled the issues of ethnic stereotyping/immigrant acculturation/ethnic identity and all the rest quite well, with genuine wit and believable shading (for example, when Kumar acknowledges there are worse ethnic stereotypes than being assumed a medical prodigy). Then again, there are darn few films that are cool on chicks, and it's even harder where the female roles are all small, as they are in this film. But if you can ignore this failing, or just don't care about it, I think you'll have an unreservedly good time watching this film."
2634,"Another success for Hammer studios!; After their first successes with takes on famous stories, hammer's finest trio teamed up again to make this delightful take on the legend of an Egyptian mummy, imaginatively titled 'The Mummy'. Peter Cushing is an actor that needs no introduction as he has carried many a Hammer horror production and forever engraved himself in the minds of horror fans across the globe. His performance in this film isn't his finest ever (or even his finest under Terence Fisher), but it's more than solid and, to be honest, Peter Cushing is one of the few actors that could just spend the running time doing nothing and still have this horror fan riveted, such is the power of his screen presence. Christopher Lee has proved himself as the successor to both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi on a number of occasions with his portrayals of the classic monsters, and although he's never surpassed the great masters; this is another of those occasions. Of course, the one and only Terence Fisher direct the film. Fisher is an under-appreciated director in the horror genre as, although he hasn't done much outside of Hammer, the films he made for Hammer are what have gone on to be some of their most respected classics. This is another one. The film looks great, and despite the fact that it's low budget and was shot well over forty years ago, the colours and locations still bode well, and give the film a fresh feel. The Hammer style camp feeling is very much on display in The Mummy, and for the Hammer fan; that can only be a good thing. The Egypt setting marks a nice departure for the team, as up until this point, audiences had only seen them together in more urban settings. To be honest, aside from Boris Karloff's performance, I didn't much like the Universal classic. I don't hesitate, therefore, to label this film superior in every respect other than the lead. This version of the story is handled in a way that is much easier to like than Karl Freud's version. The story itself is a more than interesting one, and ties in the intrigue of the Egyptian civilisation, with themes of modern society breaking their sacred code to have a museum full of relics, which is really quite thought-provoking."
8371,"Nice action with average plot; ** HERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS ** Recap: Riddick (Diesel) is a hunted man. He constantly has mercs on his track and he heads to Helion Prime to find the one who posted the bounty. It turns out to be his old friend the Imam (David). Helion Prime is facing the threat of the Necromongers, an almost invincible cult with it's own armada and army. To conquered people the Necromongers give the choice: convert or fight. To fight means certain death. However the Imam and a the Elementar Aeron (Dench) thinks Riddick is the man that can defeat the Mecromongers. But Riddick has his own plans. ""Jack"" is missing, imprisoned on the hellish planet Crematoria. So he must go there to rescue her, but now the Necromongers are on his trail. The Lord Marshal's (Feore) most trusted captain Vaako (Urban) is sent for him and complicates matter. My Thoughts: A very entertaining movie, with a different style than the previous movie. This is more focused on action and choreographed fights, and the very aggressive Riddick. However, it is done well so I see no fault there. The plot is average, mostly about putting Riddick in dangerous positions that he has to fight himself out of. But it is good enough. Some new interesting characters, especially Dench's Aeron, adds to the positive side as well. Diesel is also very good as Riddick himself. Nice design of costumes and scenery, most (or all) I guess is computer made, with nice special effects. Overall an entertaining movie. 7/10"
4941,"What's the deal with Brian Blessed?; Who designed Brian Blessed's hawkman outfit? I mean come on, that skirt/ stubby short thing was so so so short, it was bad enough when he was standing up. But when he sat down......uh oh! You can see all the way up the tunnel! Past those 2 huge, hairy drumsticks. And another question i have about Brian Blessed's character is when they are about to battle Ming at the end of the movie. Why can't Brian just say ""first wave dive"" Instead he says ""first wave DDDDIIIIIIIIIIIIVVVVVE.EH"" If any of you own this movie, i would love for you all to go back and watch that scene. It never fails to make me giggle. But the best performance of the movie came from ""Lizard man"" Why did they even bother having him in the movie? All he did was walk around for a split second, and have that weird hovering talking thing say ""escape is impossible Lizard man"" and zap him. I love the way the lizards eyes are in their mouths. Any who thats about all I've got to say for myself. What a fantastic movie. A personal favourite."
31223,"Excellent!; Don't be swayed by the negative reviews...I don't know what it takes for some folks to enjoy a movie! I took my 8 year old to see this and we both spent most of the movie in laughter. There is something for EVERYONE in this film! On top of a great story and an enjoyable script, there are many, many lessons for children to learn within this film. It was so good to hear children splitting their sides in laughter during the movie. And, in places, adult laughter drowned out the kids! This movie has humor on all levels. It will definitely be added to our DVD collection upon release. This is Rudy and The Little Engine That Could all rolled into one. Don't miss this or you'll be sorry!"
8376,"I LOVE Pedro, Napoleon and Deb!!; I was delighted a few years ago when Wes Anderson came out with Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums. But the people who did Napoleon Dynamite took it several steps further. I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up in the Criterion Collection as well. Halfway through my second viewing of Napoleon, I noticed that it had put a persistent grin on my face that would not go away. I can see how many people would enjoy this film just for how painfully well the character studies were done. I personally feel validated, understood, redeemed, etc., and I love Napoleon, Pedro and Deb. A prime example of how the synergy of great script, acting and directing can make you care so much about a character in a movie that it hurts. Hopefully there will be ""more where this came from..."""
3060,"Raw and Real; A terrific story of a struggling Dublin band who have to deal with the political struggles of artistic disagreement and Street life for the lower classes. Beautifully crafted, this movie is engrossing, raw and realistic and it contains one of the finest soundtracks ever recorded, performed by some truly talented musicians. Brilliantly cast and a well written slick script, this film is a must for any blues lover. Not for everyone, but still a great film A Solid 8/10"
30816,"Bad!; I don't know if this has to do w/ seeing the play first, but i went with a group to see this and myself and the others who have seen the Broadway play thought this movie sucked. I absolutely loved the play, and this movie had the potential to be great, but I hated it. I thought it was too long, and it was boring (I fell asleep). To make matters significantly worse, The Phantom Couldn't Sing!!! Everyone else I could bear, but the Phantom absolutely sucked! The thing that bothered me the most more than anything at all was how badly everyone lip-synced. I mean, they're singing opera- they should be opening their mouths a bit more than a quarter of an inch wide. Then, the costumes were lousy compared to the play. You can notice this especially during the ""masquerade"" scene. The phantom especially comes out in this lame costume that can't even compare to the one he wears in the play. I mean, it's a movie- don't they have any funding? I was quite disappointed in this, and it's not like it had to be a sucky movie just because it was originally a Broadway musical- Chicage was awesome! I don't know how this turned out so bad..."
6503,"A waste of a story; I quite liked the first Charlie's Angels film, it was, in a word, quirky. This film was a huge let-down and I'm glad that I didn't spend any money on it. The opening sequence rescuing the American agent was reasonable, though not a patch on the original. As the storyline developed it became clear that it didn't seem to know where it was going. The musical inserts were initially interesting, but by the time the end of the film came, they were getting very annoying. It seemed that it was trying to out-Moulin rouge Moulin Rouge. The Irish Mob was a good touch, being from Ireland, I like the concept, the only problem is that a bit of research would have revealed that no respectable Irish mobster would go around like a 1960's London bovver boy. The accents were so corny it was painful! I'm still trying to figure out what the thin man had to do with the story, other than screaming for haircuts every time he appeared. As a trio Barrymore, Diaz and Liu are very good, the main letdown I would have to say would be the director. His C.V. is way too light to take on a project of this nature. I've heard him described as someone who had complete autonomy when making the film and his inexperience shows. Rather than going for a smooth flowing film, he goes for disjointed set-pieces which are in essence taken from other films. This is good as a spoof film, but it's nothing more than a waste of the talent of the actresses involved in its making."
108862,"One of Fulcci's best; A very entertaining science fiction flick with motorcycles, Fred Williamson and theological discussion about the source of evil... who can ask for more? the film even portrays Nietzsche's saying that god is dead, in a very entertaining way. Who can ask for more? Maybe you! Fulcci displays did some very interesting work on some of the scenes. Interesting shooting, wonderful sets (reminded me of blade runner) and great eighties music which reminds one of Dario Argento film. this film is a precursor for running man and like Lloyd Kaufmann says on the DVD edition I watched - it is certainly much much better than Ridley Scott's Gladiator... For anyone who considers himself a Fulcci fan, this film is a must."
6345,"Awesome; I cant seem to understand why this movie only has a 5.7 rating here. It boggles my mind considering I thought the movie was amazing. Michael Douglas does an amazing performance and the dancing is spectacular, at least in my view. Maybe, and this is a good possibility, you are all being faithful to the musical, and in comparison the movie is crap... That is also possible, but having not seen the musical and having an unbiased opinion, I would have to say this movie was awesome and I highly recommend it. The other thing that I really enjoyed about this movie was the different characters and how well one got to see their personalities throughout the film. This is more plot than anything, and those of you making comparisons may find this boring, but I especially found Cassie, Miss Morales, Paul, and Bebe to be fabulous in their roles, and exceptional dancers. I hope you all enjoy this film as much as I did."
8376,"This movie is frickin sweet!!!!!; I live in a small town,where access to films in the theater is limited, especially when it comes to obscure ones. So I rented Napoleon the day it was released on DVD, I bought it two days later. It has become a conversation mainstay in this small town, most of the young people here have seen it and quote it on a daily basis. I am definitely one of those people. When we're at work, or just sitting around doing nothing, the word gosh! has become much more prevalent in our conversations. This is one of the BEST films I have seen in a long time. How anyone can see this film and not fall over laughing is beyond me. Its ingenious, its superb, its its its well its frickin sweet!"
8666,"Great movie - Don't believe the critics!; I love Catwoman! What a great movie!! I had no expectations prior to watching this movie, thank's to all the negative criticism from newspapers and members at IMDb! So who would blame me for not wanting to watch this movie? It seems to me that there has been a hype to slaughter this movie and many have been tempted to follow! In my opinion Catwoman is not as good as X-Men or Spiderman, I admit that, but far better than Hellboy, Hulk and Daredevil! I think Halle Berry was the perfect choice as Catwoman and hope there will be an sequel! The story is not original and revolutionary by all means, but for the audience that expects to be entertained and not lectured, Catwoman absolutely deliver!"
1003,"Playing God; Having read the Michael Palmer's book a few years ago, I missed the screen version on purpose. Sometimes a book stays vividly in one's imagination that it's inevitably to make unfair comparisons between the movie and what we remember of the book. When this film showed on cable the other day, it was a good excuse to watch it because of its director, Michael Apted, and its cast. If you haven't watched the movie, please stop reading now. The mere idea of a scientist using humans as guinea pigs for his experiments is thoroughly repugnant. Yet, what Mr. Palmer presented in his novel, and what it's at stake here is how easy it is to gather unsuspecting people to experiment with them a technique that might be fatal, as it's proved in the opening sequence of the film. We watch in horror how the bald headed man lands up in the emergency room of the big city hospital where Guy Luthan, the up and coming intern, faces a crisis in trying to help this poor man who goes into convulsions and whose blood pressure goes up and down without any logical explanation. The strange illness affecting this man is not known until he tells the doctor a name that might be a medicine, a procedure, or a place. Because of Dr. Luthan's quest to unravel the mystery behind this patient, he ends up being at odds with the scientist who's been conducting the procedure, Dr. Myrick. This man the key to whatever happens to young Guy Luthan, who doesn't give up against all the conspiracy around him, risking his life at different times. As a thriller, ""Extreme Measures"" offers a great ride for the fans of an accomplished thriller. Mr. Apted has directed with verve. The only weak link with the film is a bland Hugh Grant in the leading role. Mr. Grant is an excellent comedy actor. His take Guy Luthan is fine, but one wonders what another actor would have been able to do with the role. Gene Hackman, as Dr.Myrick, shows why he is a class act. Mr. Hackman is totally believable as the mad man with no scruples. His reasoning at the end is chilling. Yes, there are people that die every day, but is it for him to determine which ones will be his victims in search of a possible discovery for what he is trying to accomplish? After all, like Guy tells him, these people didn't choose to participate in the experiment, at all.. The supporting cast is good. David Morse, who we have seen in the theater in many plays in the New York stage, is one of the best character actors working in movies these days. His account of the FBI man, Frank Hare, shows a man torn between a paralyzed wife, that might be saved by Dr. Myrick's experiment and his blind loyalty to a mad scientist. Bill Nunn, Paul Guilfoyle, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Debra Monk add another dimension to the film. The movie will entertain as well as will make the viewer think about how far can science go when the power is in the hands of a crazy person. Michael Apted direction shows great flair in telling the story."
7486,"an excellent love story; i have seen this movie twice now and have enjoyed it both times. it is shot in an undeniably flashy style, which can at times seem unnecessary, but it is so well acted and unusual in theme that it can be forgiven this stylistic error. it is an often painful look at a relationship between two men who are attracted to each other, but who are also tormented by their love. it will have resonances for anyone who has been in an intense partnership, but especially for gay men - who will also be entranced by the two gorgeous leads. i advise you to ignore the carping of the previous mailer and go see!"
5134,"Mean Machine; Mean Machine is one of the great Ska Films from the UK. ska films also noted for brit flicks such as lock stock and two smoking barrels and the more known snatch, have blended the same ingredients from there previous films to create another screen gem. Vinnie Jones, considering his background plays a great part and plays it well, helped greatly of course by the other strong characters. Maybe not being fully understood by American audience, the characters, either realistically or stereotypically, represent prison life be it screws, cons or the big men. i felt it managed to have violence without being over violent and still spread in a good few laughs, never forgetting bob and bob the commentators. of course the ending was a tad predictable but any other way would make it depressing, the underdog always wins. overall a good film for the budget, with a dashing of low key actors making it memorable and kind of cult film. an A grade"
4962,"Texas Hot Sauce needed for this dry piece of meat; Does anyone have any sauce for this rotted piece of meat I would like to call a film? It has left this dry taste in my mouth that I feel only some A1 or actual oxen blood would be able to quench. Seriously, this was one of the worst excuses for a western film that I have seen in a very long time. I grew up watch the ""Duke"" with my father and was always impressed with the vast landscape of the uncharted America and the troubles that faces these pioneers on a daily basis. I expect to see that same quality or better in the westerns that are made today because we have the technology to make them stronger, more entertaining, and powerful, but I guess Texas Rangers decided to go a different route. They decided to hire a TV director and a bunch of TV stars to help create that sense of reality in the film. So, instead of seeing Texas through the eyes of the adventuresome, we witnessed Texas through a sound stage in Hollywood as our youth of the WB whimpered in their trailers and thought about the girls of tomorrow. Who decided on final casting for this film? I know the Weinsteins were not behind this, or were they? This was the biggest hurdle to overcome in this film, and while I spent most of my energy on that, I discovered that there were actually more hurdles to follow. The story coupled with the poor production was another hit to this already devastating picture. Let's talk about the actors that chose to place their names to this picture. How about I actually start with a quote from Dylan McDermott from the supplemental features of this DVD. He says something along the lines of, ""Material like this doesn't come around everyday, and when it comes to your door, you have to take it because you never know when it will be around again."" Can we be certain he was talking about Texas Rangers? I wonder how much he was paid for that sound bite. The material was rated second worst behind the acting in this film. Anyone with a 4th grade reading skill could see this. I guess McDermott had someone else reading his work for him. While I would say that McDermott was the only one holding this film, he continually dropped it on more than one occasion. His character was decent, but not the greatest hero that I have seen emerge from the Mason-Dixon line. I think what hurts him the most was that he had to work next to James Van Der Beek, who never felt like a hero to me. I never really watched Dawson's Creek, but I have this feeling that he brought some of his character from the television show to the film. It was embarrassing to see him act, especially during his climactic ending that seemed more like amateur night at the local bar instead of acting. Can we be certain that this wasn't community theater we were witnessing, except with a bigger budget? The same can be said for Randy Travis, Usher (in a very pathetic role), Kutcher (suffers miserably from miscast syndrome), and Molina (typecast for the paycheck, and it was very obvious in this film). I think that most were so excited to be working with their friends, that they forgot that this was an actual paying role and they would need to put some work into it. Even Rachael Leigh Cook was absurd. Her final speech in the film had me laughing hysterically, and it wasn't intended to be funny in the least bit. Miner completely miscast this entire film, and it is obvious from the revenue that nobody else was buying it either. With no support from the actors the story was sure to fall, and it did. There was nothing spectacular or original about the story. I have even read articles that state that the overall story behind this film was false and very fabricated. How can you take yourself seriously when you are trying to make a true story from fiction? Only Charlie Kaufmann could successfully do this and I did not see his name anywhere on the credits. This was a shoddy piece of workmanship that does not deserve to be called either a ""western"" or a ""adventure"" or a ""drama"". I would only use the word ""junk"" to describe what Miner has created. Overall, if you couldn't tell already, I didn't like this film. From the opening credits until the futile ending it was nothing but pain souring through my eyes and mind as I watched the story unfold. The ensemble acting proved that you could bring together all the wrong people and create 100% disaster. Nobody in this film seemed to fit in the least bit. With the actors completely miscast, the story seemed like wet paper. Nothing was of any substance. This was a poor excuse for a film, a poor excuse for history, and a poor excuse to try to appeal to the pre-teen girls of America. Hopefully we have all learned a lesson from this and can move on without any troubles. GULP. I hope Grade: * out of *****"
8965,"A wonderful story, a great message, timeless, a classic; My wife and I have now been to see this show 5 times. Our first regret is that we waited until it had been out a month before going to see it. Our second regret is that we did not get to see it in IMAX 3D. Our IMAX had only regular which was still great. The movie is a living animation and unique. It is so real that many attending complain because they do not allow themselves to get past the realism of the technology used and just enjoy the show. It has a marvelously simple and yet great story. The sound track is unbelievably great. It communicates a message that has become lost with commercialization. It is timeless, and will be a classic. Our only hope is that they will bring it back next year so we can go to Seattle and see it in 3D. Go to the movie and sit back and allow yourself to be drawn into the shows magic. You will not believe how fast the movie goes. Absolutely the greatest."
8814,"Bears, Rednecks, and Three Morons = Morality Tale.; Our film starts off looking to be a surprise buddy flick gem, such as ""Crossing The Bridge, or Good Will Hunting."" It begins with three friends going to the funeral of their deceased ""daredevil"" friend. All three of our heroes, starring Scott Evil, Shaggy, and I am famous because I work with Ashton Kutcher; decide to venture off into the wilderness in search of DB Cooper's treasure. I mean this with all honesty, this to me had the makings of a great buddy film. The DB Cooper part of the film gave me a good ""Goonies"" vibe, but the film goes stale trying to hard to be funny. From a bear attack that goes awry, to two of the stupidest rednecks in the history of stupid rednecks (and that is saying something), to dog's tripping on pot (I know Hollywood smokes the green occasionally, so why do they always make heads have visuals. I know several heads, and being a former head myself, I nor they have ever tripped off of weed.). Burt Reynolds makes a brief appearance and shows us exactly why they say he is the biggest actor to ever star in so many bombs, his range is so limited as seen in this film. The plot is not bad at all, in fact to some degree is somewhat a original spin on an overused idea (White Water Summer, Deliverence, City Slickers, etc.). I also must say that Dax (from Punk'd fame) is the stand out in this film's cast. However, over all the film loses way too much merit on trying to be too cute. Take out the bear attack, the marijuana field scene, Burt Reynolds, and make the rednecks about ten percent less stupid and you have yourself one hell of a gem. Those factors, however to me make this film barely average, and ruin an otherwise good idea. Watch it for entertainment, watch it for fun, and then forget about it. 5 of 10 crows drown."
31494,"There Goes the Neighborhood (and here comes a winner of a movie!); After seeing Jim McKay's ""Girls Town"" and ""Our Song"" (both shot VERY cheaply on video), I was totally unprepared for the beauty of EVERYDAY PEOPLE. It's gorgeously shot and edited and looks like a million bucks. Considering that it's mostly about a depressed Brooklyn neighborhood, this is all the more amazing. Whether this is due to the cinematographer, to McKay's direction, or just--at last--a bigger budget via HBO, I don't know. But congrats to all concerned. The movie itself is as wonderful as anything McKay has yet done. A famous Brooklyn eating hole looks like it's going out of business to make way for gentrification, and we viewers get to meet and spend some time with the owners and waiters, their relatives and friends, and even some of the ""gentrifiers."" The mix is bracing. Nobody ends up hero or villain, and if the movie never reaches the heights of great tragedy, comedy or romance, it also never overdoes anything. Scenes last only as long as they need to, each performance is real and exact, and by the end I'll bet you'll have chuckled often, (almost) shed a tear or two, and certainly better understood what a changing neighborhood means to a host of different people. As simple as ""Everyday People"" appears to be, this kind of ensemble of people and social issues is not easy to pull off without undue soapboxing. But McKay, his cast and his crew have done it. (And Billoah Greene, who plays Samel, should be going places, FAST!)"
103990,"Troma's Best!!; Thank God for troma! This is the epitome of low budget classic film making. Lloyd Kaufmen delivers the goods with TROMA'S WAR. GORE! GORE! GORE! NUDITY! AND it's funny to! Troma is not known for it's big budgets but this one appears to have the biggest budget of any of their previous works. And you can tell that every dime went into the production. Lloyd put together an impressive cast for this one, and introduced us to the great Joe Fleshieker (who returned in other Troma classics). The action is great. This is what we have coem to expect from Troma. This is troma at it's best. I also recommend Toxic Avenger 1-3, Citizen Toxie, and Bloodsucking Freaks. Jesse"

I give two for this movie because it still has something from a nice comedy,but Bratislava sequence was such a bad joke that i can hardly forget it. And please,if A Manchester Utd fan-club is locate in London,land of Arsenal and Chelsea,i eat my hat."
32632,"Criminally obscure film has more to offer than 90% of modern day fare.; Before he found himself on the wrong side of a murder investigation, Blake was noted for playing an unconventional cop on the TV show ""Baretta"" (and also the flip side as a brutal killer in the film ""In Cold Blood"".) Here he is a square peg trying to fit into a round hole as a California Highway Patrolman with dreams of more. At 5'4"", he is a full head shorter than the shortest of his fellow motorcycle-riding fellow officers. Though his cohort Bush balances his days between sitting on his bike reading comic books and listening to the radio with pulling over anyone even remotely suspicious, Blake yearns to be a better cop than that and, ultimately, a detective. When (after a thoroughly gripping opening sequence) a man is found shot to death, Blake seizes the opportunity to piece the situation together and becomes the driver and right hand man to hotshot detective Ryan. As the pair attempts to solve the mystery of the man's death, their faults, attributes and insecurities are laid bare (notably in an extended scene with Riley, a barmaid who has known both men for a long time.) Finally, the truth of the death comes to light, but only after significant turmoil, carnage and some surprises. Blake is terrific in the lead. He perfectly captures the awkwardness mixed with ambition of his character. He has many memorable scenes, more than a few of which that poke fun at his size (though he was in great physical shape at the time.) Bush lends strong support as his rather amoral buddy. Ryan is splendidly authoritarian and paints a memorable portrait of a man who is a big shot (especially in his own mind) every time and everywhere except when it counts. He is perfect in the role. Cook has a very showy and effective role as a mentally challenged old man who discovers the body. Riley is effective in her sleazy, but sympathetic role, but her big scene does seem out of place somehow and shifts the focus of the movie more than it probably ought to. Dano, a strong character actor in countless TV and film projects, does an excellent job as a jaded coroner (a far cry from ""Quincy M.D."", he not only eschews a surgical mask, but smokes a cigarette during the autopsy!) The film is gorgeously photographed and extremely creatively directed. It had to be way ahead of its time in terms of camera-work. The texture and atmosphere of the scenes is beyond most of what is cranked out today. It's also loaded with quirkiness and irony (some might say overloaded.) In any case, it's a unique viewing experience with many rewards for the patient and incisive viewer. There's also a motorcycle chase that rivals any of the best from this period. Like so many films, the only way it can be fully appreciated is in the widescreen format. The glimpses of Monument Valley are welcome and add much to the visual appeal of the film. The film isn't completely flawless, but it is highly memorable. The title refers to the make and color of a motorcycle."
965,"A wickedly entertaining Hitchcock thriller!; This film was one of the turning points in Alfred Hitchcock's career. It shed light on the film-maker, and helped the rest of the world catch on to what a genius he was. The 39 Steps is classic Hitchcock, containing so many of the elements of what made him The Master of Suspense. You have the handsome ""everyman,"" played by Robert Donat. There is the beautiful blonde, a staple in practically every Hitchcock picture. Dark humor, plot twists, suspense, and a climactic surprise ending; This film is a wonderful display of Hitch's powers! The story of Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) is one of spies, government secrets, and conspiracy. It all sounds cliché, but Hitchcock puts your fears at ease early on when Hannay dismisses the whole thing by saying, ""It sounds like a spy story."" The mysterious Ms. Annabella Smith replies, ""That's exactly what it is."" Hitchcock takes an old story, and injects it with life, through his dark humor and the brilliant plot twists that occur. I don't want to spoil it for you. This is a tremendously enjoyable movie, one that must not be missed by any Hitchcock fan!"
8983,"Nice story, but thin.; The film is visually entertaining and quite stunning at times. The cast is charming in their rather operatic fashion. The story is basically an expanded bedtime story with an attempt to make it a thriller by planting some plot turns. The action sequences are intriguing, but they are transparently staged. The editing is not great. There are visible breaks in sequence. The special effects are excellent, but they are rather thinly placed in the film. Unlike a Jackie Chan movie, this one plods along between the big scenes. I was bored several times during the film. It seems to me that the evolving Chinese film industry has become stuck on this epic/martial arts boiler plate without really developing any depth in its acting, plots and shooting techniques. Sadly, this film suffers from all those flaws."
2640,"Timeless comic-book classic; After all these years, Superman the Movie is still better than most superhero films, nay films altogether. The story revolves around Clark Kent, and his transition into the American hero 'Superman', and of course his budding romance with reporter Lois Lane. Gene Hackman is superb as the cocky villain Lex Luthor, and Marlon Brando makes an appearance as Superman's father. What I like about this film is the 'epic' quality it has to it, mainly due to the design of Krpton and Brando's performance. This is then extended by the late Christopher Reeve, who played his alter-ego's separately, and along with the genius of Donner et all, really made us believe a man could fly! A timeless classic."
7318,"More gratuitously violent than the worst slasher film; I think most every critique I've heard pro and con about THE PASSION so far has been colored by ideological glasses. The Jewish contingent hated it because they perceived it as portraying the Jews in a bad light. I understand that, but I can find lots of titles that portray different groups not to their liking. My criticism -- the real objection to how the Jews were portrayed -- was that they were nothing but caricatures, the result of a terrible script and worse directing. This is the worst failing that can be leveled at any screenplay and any director, and it impugns the integrity of the film more than political overtones. This is the same criticism leveled at the portrayal of the Roman soldiers -- they are nothing caricatures. Can it be that not a single Roman had ANY trace of compassion or humanity? How stereotyped is that? And how totally unbelievable. If anything, the Italians should be even more insulted than the Jews about the portrayal of their country men. But then comes the gratuitous, unrelenting violence....it is abhorrent. I got it Mr. Gibson -- Christ was scourged. I got it in the first 3 min of the scourging; I got it after the next 15 minutes. To prolong those torture scenes was about the most viscous, unnecessary violence I have ever seen on a movie screen. I would have thought there would have been an outcry from every corner of the political and religious spectrum about that -- from the Jews, from the Christians and the especially from the Churches since all that violence was nothing more than using the suffering of Christ, whether you think he is the Lord or just a poor guy caught up in the politics of the day, he was a human being and to trade on that suffering to make a movie sensational, debases all of us. But I guess gratuitous violence is tolerable, even perfectly acceptable if it is enlisted to prove some religious ideology. The film teaches us nothing. Not about the man, not about his divinity, not about the underlying historical context in which he was sacrificed -- absolutely nothing. I think it is a loathsome film and I am ashamed that so-called religious people overlooked all that is wrong with it and praised it just because, whether consciously or unconsciously, they could use it as a kind of weapon against another religious group. It is despicable mix feeding on violence and religious sensibilities to make a buck....it is so crass that even Hollywood, much to its credit, turned it down. But I guess where there is a buck to be made, SOMEONE will grab it to make more, no matter how sleazy the project. The fact that it was made independently of Hollywood doesn't absolve it of its glaring, disgusting faults."
34729,"Gritty, Orwellian nightmare that falls WAY short.; While Paranioa 1.o has a darkness and a mood of sublime terror it's script seems to propose questions and never answers any of them. The direction is one note with set-up piece after set-up piece being displayed and it never seems to make any kind of statement. Is Simon really infected? Is he really a victim of a conspiracy to infect the entire building? Or is all his imagination designed to feed his own paranoia to justify his own existence? Instead he buys and drinks a lot of milk which is REALLY over priced. One time he goes to the store and buys a half-gallon of milk with a newspaper and one other item and his total is over $20. The movie LOOKS great and it is very tense throughout but Jeremy Sisto (whom I love as an actor and also co-produced this movie) is miscast as Simon. I felt I was watching and actor acting like he was paranoid not an actor really paranoid. Paranioa 1.0 works on some of the basic levels but is otherwise an empty and convoluted mess. ** out of 4"
31221,"All I can say is...wow.; From the sweeping start of this motion picture to the energetic bedsheet climax, this picture is a sure likely picture to receive some accolades by next Oscar season. Several aspects of this movie are so wholly successful and only add to the tone and mood. Jennifer Garner's performance is nothing short of fantastic. Her body language alone shows that she is ready for more roles like this that demand so much of her personality and acting skills. The scene of her contemplating on whether to kill a father and his daughter is one for the books. Garner's sex appeal also doesn't hurt, as she has quite a nice look and is not hard to watch in close-ups. This movie isn't a one-person show though. Also stunning in this movie is Terrence Stamp, who plays an old man named Stick. Not only does he carry most of the dry humour of this movie, but he also is blind. And you can't get any better than that. The scene where he stares blankly but you know he can't see is just a measure of how fantastic this movie is. The movie's plot centers around Elektra, as she has returned from the dead after dying in Daredevil and exacted her revenge as an assassin-for-hire. Of course, this means the first person she gets close to ends up being her next target. She totally calls it off, helps the man and his daughter to safety, and it begins a sequence of events leading up to a battle with her employers, the Hand. With a few surprises every once in a while AND blind people, this will more than likely prove to be one of the best movies ever made. You can have your Citizen Kane, Star Wars, and Casablanca. When it comes out on DVD, I'll stick with my twelve consecutive viewings of Elektra on a Sunday night going into Monday afternoon. Note: I got in for free, but you should buy a ticket for each show that day. Trust me, it's worth it. You'll get something new out of it every time. Other note: This is coming from a reviewer that hates Star Wars, Casablanca, Pulp Fiction, Boondock Saints, Reservoir Dogs, ANY Johnny Depp or Tom Hanks movie. They are all pieces of trash. My favourites include Howard the Duck, Cube, Darkness, and of course, The Stupids. Thank you."
88471,"I ...killed ...my ...baby!; It's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" for the ladies. This one has 2 Nurse Ratched's (Constance Ford and Joan Crawford), a mute character who finally speaks, electro shock therapy, and an impromptu party thrown by the inmates. Though seriously intended, watching Polly and friends go crackers is seriously funny. Bergen will have you rolling in the aisles, and the supporting cast of inmates, who are much more lively and entertaining than the dull staff, provide many moments of hilarity. Though she looks more like Medusa, Crawford plays Lucretia, and easily dominates every scene she's in. Hall Bartlett's direction combines expressionistic effects with documentary-like scenes. Elmer Bernstein's music is appropriately overwrought, and the excellent cinematography is by Lucien Ballard . The road to hell(uva-a-good-time} is paved with sincere intentions. No less believable than ""The Snake Pit"" or ""Girl Interrupted"", it's a lot more fun. If you get the opportunity watch it. It's memorably over the top."
5219,"Watchable, competent, forgettable; RESIDENT EVIL Aspect ratio: 1.85:1 Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS A group of highly-trained commandos enter a research facility which has been sealed shut following the release of a deadly toxin, but their escape route is cut off by hordes of flesh-eating zombies created by the toxic gas... Based on an ultra-successful computer game, this routine potboiler (directed by Paul W.S. Anderson) marks time between set-pieces, and barely makes an impression. Despite a top-line cast (including Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Eric Mabius, James Purefoy, Colin Salmon and Martin Crewes) and excellent production values, Anderson's movie replicates the computer game's limitless excess, and reduces its characters to the status of zombie fodder, despite a handful of plot twists which set the dwindling survivors against one another as the zombie hordes descend from all sides. The action scenes are chaotic but unmemorable, and some of the gore appears to have been curtailed for censorship reasons. Watchable, competent, forgettable. Followed by RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE (2004). (English version)"
8835,"Cole Hauser gets his shot finally.; I may be the only one outside of the Hauser family who has been waiting for son of B-movie star Wings Hauser, Cole to get his shot. He is a show stealer from small roles such as his roles in (Dazed and Confused, and Good Will Hunting). I never thought that he would get a leading part, but now he does in a Icon Pictures (Mel Gibson's company) release known as Paparazzi. The film starts off with Beau Laramie (Hauser) getting his first shot in a action film (the irony of Cole Hauser getting his first shot in an action film, playing an actor getting his first shot in an acting film is quite laughable). He becomes an overnight sensation and therefore has to begin personal dealings with the ""Mondern Day Hunters"" the Paparazzi. After shots of he and his family on a nudist beach are published he decides to approach a member of the Paparazzi and politely asks the man not to take pictures of his family. The man ignores this request and Beau Laramie slugs him, this causing the life of the up and coming star to spin out of control. He and his family are in an automobile accident after being chased and blinded by the Paparazzi, causing his Laramie's wife to lose her spleen and son to go in a coma. The revenge plot begins, and the action takes off. The film looks great, it has an independent feel, with just the right amount of Hollywood to make it not seem like a USA movie of the week. The acting is hit and miss, with only two of the cast members actually giving what I would consider a consistent performance Dennis Farrina (who in my opinion makes Dennis Franz look like a rookie cop in comparison to cop acting roles), and Tom Sizemore gives perhaps the best performance of his career in this (that is arguable). I was impressed with Cole Hauser though I think a few scenes were too stale, he does a great over all job, just maybe not good enough to win him another leading part in the near future. Daniel Baldwin is the Mister Stinky of this one. Of the Baldwins I always said that Daniel was almost as good as Alec, but with a performance like he shows in Paparazzi I think Steven and Billy both crawl over his rotten carcass. He looks to be reaching way too much for his role, and tries too hard to be the standout. An argument can be made that he does stand out, but it is not for good acting, it's for bad casting job by the casting director. The film has in my opinion on major flaw that makes it overall unsatisfying. There are way too many cameos and too many mentions of celebrities in this film to pull it off as a world unto itself (which is what every movie should strive to pull off). Mel Gibson, Matthew McCaugnehay, Chris Rock make appearances while mentions of George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, and Alec Baldwin are made. The most irritating of the mentions is Alec Baldwin due to the fact that his brother is playing a character in the film, it quickly makes you lose your sense of belief. For a first film by the director and a first leading role for the star this film is a success on any other level it is an ultimate failure, but one that is not a complete waste of time. Give it a look see. 6 of 10 crows bludgeoned with a baseball bat, one left wounded."
1552,"Just Quality Fun; A really good action flick that is better than average. Cameron Poe (Cage) an unjustly in-prisoned Army Ranger, spends the first years of his daughters life behind bars, only to find himself catching a flight to freedom aboard Con Air. In typical hero fashion Poe (unable to leave a man down) has to kill all the bad guys and 'save the f***ing day'. OK so its typical Hollywood gung-ho action, but its great entertainment and really does have some fine characters (Malkovich) undoubtedly steals the show with another excellent performance. Just unplug you mind, turn up the volume, turn out the lights and watch the good guys triumph against all odds in true Hollywood style. Brilliant fun, when you're in the mood. 8/10"
2921,"The Man With No Name returns; A spaghetti western with horror influences. Sounds like a film that was written by God, directed by Jesus and shot in heaven, and it is...well, almost. Although Clint Eastwood's horror-western is undoubtedly a very nice little story, it lacks the epic vision of the classic Leone films and so can't be considered in the same divine category that it could have been if it was. The film exudes a very low budget feel, most of which comes from the very small village that has been constructed and the fact that most of the acting is terrible. It doesn't matter, though, and these things actually add to the film in the long run as they lend it the classic spaghetti western feel. As you might expect, Clint plays the character he is best known for; the Man With No Name. Here, he takes that character to the extreme as he gives a very malevolent and uncaring performance, which is far from 'the Good'. The common shoot-out scenes are present, but Clint has also decided to include a rather graphic rape scene, which will no doubt offend some viewers. Clint Eastwood is a minimalist filmmaker. His directorial style is solid and unfussy and as anyone who's ever seen a Clint Eastwood film will know; he's a man of very few words. This is of obvious advantage to the film as it means that it remains efficient throughout, which engages the audience and ensures they don't get bored. The way Clint plays the character is magnificent, as he continually makes us believe that he is infallible; which is needed for the film to work. Eastwood also succeeds in creating a cerebral atmosphere, which gives the film it's element of fascination. The fact that Eastwood directs and stars makes this a big personal achievement for him personally also. As I say, this isn't the greatest spaghetti western of all time; but it's a long way from the worst and fans of Eastwood will be in heaven seeing him perform his greatest role again."
8636,"Superior sequel that lacks vitality; Before I start, let me say that I thought Spider-Man 2 was superior in every way to Spider-Man 1, but one. Honestly, I don't know what it was about Spider-Man 2 that I found lacking. While it was a better movie with excellent effects, great performances, well-conceived plot elements, and beautiful film shots, it still felt ""flat"" in comparison to Spider-Man 1. Perhaps it was the fact that Peter had to surrender the mask this time. Or maybe it's that he wants to be with MJ so badly, but can't find the intestinal fortitude to be happy AND a super hero. Or it could be that I expected much more with a $61M budget increase. Whatever the dilemma, apparently it was felt by other movie-goers, since the return for that increased budget was down $23M from the first installment. This was like Superman 2 in that our hero chooses to be an earth-bound human to be with the gal he loves, discovers there's a new menace and immediately regrets his decision. Perhaps that was why it felt ""flat."" It's been done. But then again, what hasn't? This was a superior story with superior effects and action sequences that looked realistically played out rather than the CGI mess that was the first installment. Peter coming clean with Aune Mae was a difficult scene to watch. It was a courageous step on the character's part, and Aunt Mae reacted much the way I expected she would which lent a believable tone to the scene. The villain this time around is done extremely well. Gone is the camp of the first installment's treatment of the nemesis, and enters an age of superior CGI. After Spider-Man 1's Green Goblin, I was frankly reluctant in seeing this chapter. I'm glad, now, that I have. Doc Ock is malevolently beautiful in both design and execution. I thoroughly enjoyed his character. While the first Spider-Man rates a 7.4 (at IMDb) and received two Oscar nominations and Spider-Man 2 received none (but strangely, receives a 7.9 rating here at IMDb) the second installment was definitely above the original in every noticeable way. Yet it grossed less with a bigger budget and received no special effects Oscar nominations like the inferior Spider-Man 1 did, which leads me to believe that the lacking element, whatever that may be, affected more than just this movie Fiend. It rates an 8.2/10 from... the Fiend :."
648,"Loved the action but hated the betrayal of the original series; I am a huge fan of spyflicks & series and I was happy when I learned that M.I. was to be made but to me it was a complete betrayal of the entire series that Jim Phelps turned traitor. We have followed him from when he formed the unit & his fatherly caring for his fellow agents, I feel that it was totally wrong & outside the character for his betrayal of IMF & his country. A way for the makers of the movie franchise to redeem themselves was to make a new movie in which it turns out that the Phelps that was killed in M.I. in fact was an infiltrator and that the real Phelps had been held captured thus the new mission was to rescue him and destroy his captors plans to implement their own perverted version of IMF. If Phelps was killed it really didn't matter as long as he was still a hero. He might die saving Hunts life thus there would be no conflict with a returning IMF leader. I give this only 5 stars out of 10 due to the betrayal."
157687,"Funny & safe for the kids; This was good! I liked what I've seen of the original series and the movie didn't let me down.The characters are the best thing about YUA (I love the Chief, Yoriko, Aoi, and Nakajima Ken!), and we get a chance to see some different sides to them in the movie. It's way more serious than the series, but still very funny, and it's something I can watch with my kids without feeling dumbed-down or bored out of my mind. The dub is one of Coastal Carolina ADR's productions, who consistently produce higher quality than the bigger studios. The Japanese director of the series liked Coastal's dub better than the original; the same will probably be said of the movie! http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/columns/DubTrack.php?id=7"
2421,"Mr. Miyagi and Daniel are back, and kicking some more arse; I found this movie possibly even better than the first. Daniel's new girlfriend is way cooler than his old one, she has spirit and spunk. My godson's favorite part was the fight between Chozen and Daniel at the end, while I liked the scene just after Mr. Miyagi's father died. Having lost my father myself, I thought Daniel's comments were very mature and thought-provoking. I rather neglected my father once I began going to boarding school. On holidays I would stay with one of my friends, so I did not see him much before he died. When I received word he was dying, I took a leave of absence from school to see him one last time, and now I realize that was the best thing I could have done. All of Chozen's talk of honor and how Mr. Miyagi has none is rubbish, of course. Chozen has no idea what honor is, if he finds it honourable to kill or be killed, and finds it cowardice to spare someone's life. Mr. Miyagi's words from the beginning bring the movie full circle as Daniel spares Chozen's life: ""For someone with no forgiveness in their heart, living is worse punishment than death."""
6322,"A Pretty Slick Thriller; I avoided this movie for while, i looked at the cover and put it back, looked again, put it back. Months passed and for some reason i just took a chance and bought it. I have to say i'm glad that i did. Basically its a slick thriller about money and power, with a good cast, solid plot and enough well crafted twists to make it a little special. It isn't a masterpiece, but it is certainly worth watching, and the story is linear enough to appeal to a wide audience. 8/10 If you enjoyed this you'll probably like 'SWORDFISH' and 'OCEANS 11' both have a similar feel."
8783,"He's a genius and critics are busy praising crap like Training Day and Gladiator.; I have become a great fan of M Knight over the years. Of his four films since the Sixth Sense and including it he has stunned me with his imagery and his ability to make a film ultimately look and feel real. His staple plot twists are what has made him a box office success, but ultimately you cannot watch a Knight film without feeling like you have been somewhere. The Village (to me his best film to date) is not exception. While one of the two major plot twists in this film can be seen from miles away, this does not take anything away from the film. In fact all the while why you think you have figured out the twist you are ignoring the other hints that lead to the final twist. I think Knight knew this all along and sacrificed one for the protection of the other, to me that is genius. However, I think it is ignorant if not just plain ridiculous to critique any film on it's plot twist and whether or not you can figure it out before the film maker reveals it. The Usual Suspects is still a great film almost a decade after finding out who Keyser Soze really was. The Sixth Sense was a great film and I figured out Bruce Willis' secret before it was ever revealed in the film. Let's not forget that Hollywood is the reason why we look for plot twists in every film. Knight did not overkill the ""plot twist"", nor did Brian Singer, and nor did O'Henry. The fact that in the last seven or so years at least thirty percent of the films released had plot twists from Basic to Taking Lives to Fight Club to Secret Window to In The Cut, it has been one plot twist after another. Don't blame Knight, blame Hollywood. The Village looks wonderful, and has a very fairy tale esquire feel that even Tim Burton couldn't pull off with double the budget. The is superb all around, and there is a feeling of freedom and innocence throughout the film, something few films do these days. There isn't any sex, language, and the violence is extremely mild. Knight creates his atmosphere with great set designs, amazing sounds, and superb acting. As a film in full this is a wonderful film not to be forgotten. Knight to me is the Steven Spielberg of this generation a man with a unlimited imagination, who reads people with the camera, and who is not afraid to tell a tale without gimmicks like nudity, sex, language, and violence. In this day and age where movies like Fast and The Furious dominate the box office with sex, sleaze, stupid unbelievable stunts, ridiculous Tarrentino challenges language, dumb plots, and horrible acting Knight should be a breath of fresh air to both critics and to movie fans. I for one can't wait for the next one from M Knight. Nine out of ten crows fed as an offering to Those We Don't Speak Of."
121579,"The ""Plan 9"" of killer snake movies; They have yet to make a good horror movie about poisonous snakes, but this 70's anti-classic is so bad it almost approaches goodness. It's kind of the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of killer snake movies. They couldn't really afford too many snakes or the special effects to create venom-bloated corpses, so they substituted a bunch of nonsense about military tests making the rattlesnakes go crazy (although they never explain why the snakes all hunt in packs or how they sneak up on their incredibly stupid victims). But speaking of incredibly stupid, the heroes are a male chauvinist herpetology professor and a feminist photographer, who of course fall madly in love while hunting down the killer snakes. The sexist professor insists that his job is no place for a woman, even though, aside from the snakes, all he really does is drive around the Mojave Desert, and I don't know what the female photographer is supposed to be photographing. For some reason, these two geniuses seem to do all their hunting at night (when you're hunting rattlers I guess you don't want them to see you coming). They sleep in a tent for no other reason than to wake up surrounded by snakes. Then during the climax of the film they suddenly take off to Vegas to whoop it up while the rattlers run amok. (Your snake-fighting tax dollars at work, I guess). The most famous scene involves a young housewife being attacked in the bathtub. However, this scene is neither scary nor sexy--laughably stupid perhaps. I actually liked the opening scene with the two little boys the best, but it was pretty much all downhill from there."
5159,"beautiful!; so i was a huge fern gully fan up to the age of six, and then never watched it again. after viewing it recently, the magic of the movie came back to me, as well as a few flaws. on the upside, the animation is lovely and the scenery is very colorful. the message of the movie is also very powerful, especially to a small child. no doubt, the highlight of the entire film is robin williams' character of batty, who is deliriously hysterical (i may even enjoy him more than williams' other animated alter ego, the genie). there are a zillion plot holes and it's a little bland, but overall, fern gully is more than worthwhile for any small child. i give it a 7 out of 10. see it for robin."
7987,"Great deaths--little else; A bunch of people are stranded in a remote house in England during a rainstorm. They are bitchy Rosemary (Carolyn Purdy-Gordon), her husband (Ian Patrick Williams) and their annoying little girl Judy (Carrie Lorraine). There's also a slightly overweight guy (Stephen Lee- who's supposed to be funny) and two female punk rockers. The house they're stranded in belongs to an elderly couple (Guly Rolfe, Hilary Mason) and has TONS of dolls in it. Thing is the dolls are alive...and have very nasty tempers... I thought I might enjoy this--director Stuart Gordon had made ""Re-Animator"" and ""From Beyond"" right before this--two GREAT horror films. This isn't even half as good as them. It has a creepy setting but lame dialogue (and humor), clumsy exposition and takes forever to get to the horror. But the last half hour has some VERY gory deaths (the R rating is well deserved) and some truly astounding stop-motion animation to show the dolls moving...and killing. Those sequences are definite highlights--but they're only a small portion of the film--a VERY small portion. Some pretty good acting helps the slower spots--Purdy-Gordon is excellent in her role and Rolfe and Mason wisely underplay their roles. Unfortunately Lorraine has got to be one of the most annoying little actresses out there--mo wonder this was her last movie. But, more often than not, I was bored...until the last half hour. This barely got issued in 1987 and was a total bomb. It really is easy to see why. I give it a 5."
7646,"rose reds preview; Rose Red is a horror mystery with two parts. When the first is watched the other will be one not to be missed. A group of people with psychic powers are invited to a haunted house by psychology professor Dr Joyce Reardon. Their stay awakens the spirit of former owner Ellen Rimbauer and other spirits of people who lived and died there. The secrets unravel a shocking ending, but a good one. I'd recommend this film as not one just to glance at, but one to tune into and try not to miss a single bit. It all may seem confusing at one point or another but all will be revealed at the point of the films end. It stars actress Nancy Travis and actor Matt Keeslar. If this film is seen in a shop to buy I'd buy it at any price and I recommend you do to if seen to buy."
3146,"Juvenile comedy with little to no charm or redeeming features; Rob Schneider just doesn't have the charisma or charm to be a leading man. There, I said it. He and Adam Sandler(who gets by on similar humor, but does better due to him looking as much as a child as he acts like) have been making these juvenile crude comedies for a while... I haven't bothered to count, and don't expect me to be part of the group of people grieving them when they stop. I don't see any creativity or thought put into any of their films, really, and this one is no exception. All of the gags and jokes are based on sex, bodily functions and/or fluids and crude sound effects. Come on, have a little imagination, will you? There's also one or two uninspired spoofs of popular movies. The plot is ridiculous, and is of the same type as several of Sandler/Schneider other films... the ""destroyed-something-important-have-to-fix-it-in-time"" type. Hmmm... isn't that just like another popular form of entertainment? Oh yeah, Donald Duck cartoons. Please, that plot had been done to death several decades before this was even a fart-joke in the scriptwriter's/producer's/whoever-the-hell-thought-up-this-movie's mind. The pacing is bad. The film is just basically dull and bland. The acting is nothing special. The characters are all one-note jokes, clichés and stereotypes. The humor is, as I've already said, juvenile, childish and predictable. I will be very surprised if anyone who has seen this hadn't figured out what would happen in every scene at the very beginning of it. Unlike The Animal, this doesn't have any comedic talent to make it easier to sit through(though Eddie Griffin is usually funny, he's just lame here) and no attractive leading lady(come on, Kate was as bland as they come). The only reason I can think of for sparing this film as much as a glance are the scenes in which Bree Turner's character dips her white T-shirt unwittingly in water, rendering it see-through. Apart from that, this has nothing to offer. At all. I recommend this to fans of Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider, as those are the only ones who'll find this entertaining. 5/10"
3739,"A Terrific Sophisticated Comedy With a Terrific Sophisticated Cast!; To heap more phrase on this film seems somewhat superfluous in light of the previous viewer comments...but I just can't resist!  I saw this film for the first time this past May, thanks to TCM.  I have not been able to stop watching it since.  It's such a pleasure to see a film where the special effects do not become the entire reason for its existence.  The dialogue is snappy and fast, like a back-and-forth tennis volley, with a bite and a sharpness sadly lacking in today's movies.  The cast is superb.  Kay Francis is typical Kay Francis, with an understated sadness about her.  Miriam Hopkins is terrific, both sharp and ""perky"" (usually I hate that word, but it does describe her here!).  And Herbert Marshall is simply superb...both suave and enjoyable.  The essence of a great cast, to me, has always been an ability by the actors to make you really believe that they are who they are playing - a task which everyone here accomplishes!  Again, it's just such a pleasure to see a film that doesn't insult one's intelligence, that doesn't play only for the suburban teenager or the lowest common denominator moviewatcher.         A test for me has always been whether I leave a film wishing there was more.  Well, two minutes after seeing ""Trouble,"" I found myself wishing that there had been a sequel, showing Gaston's and Lily's adventures on, say, an early 1930's transatlantic crossing.  Oh well.  I hope that the forthcoming DVD version does justice to this great comedy.  If you like movies, intelligent, sophisticated and sly movies, please see this film. And the last scene of ""Trouble in Paradise"" has become one of my very favorite endings in cinema!!"
27822,"Sharks, suspense and sick; I approached this movie quite cautiously as I had heard from friends how boring it was but I was generally pleased with this film. I was apprehensive at first as the movie appeared to have that amateur look about it which is achieved by being filmed on a handy-cam and containing no shots that last longer than 8 seconds in the first scene (yes i counted). The acting seems sugary at first but as soon as they are in the water you forget about the poor quality of the camera and the fact that these actors are unheard of. Despite this once they are stranded they seem to give off a sense of realism in their acting which is rare to find in cinema these days. The cameras bobbing up and down in the water seems to drag you into the film, making you feel like you are in the sea with them so sea-sick sufferers beware. The suspense is played out really well with good uses of silence which puts a dark edge to it. Although there are times when I hoped that there would be some one-on-one fighting with the shark things do stay interesting throughout most of the film. For people who can enjoy a film that doesn't contain 30 explosions and 4325 bullets fired but instead are willing to spend an hour and a half with a couple and their barrel of laughs (well not really) floating through a shark infested ocean with plenty of suspense and joyous acting then I would recommend this. 8/20"
318,"A true story of friendship and hard times; Shawshank Redemption is one of those infamous movies you never stop hearing about if you are a crazed movie fanatic. I've been through the entire top 250 list up and down and this is going back and fourth between #2 and #3 struggling with Lord of the Rings: The Retrun of the King. I had to see this movie to see what all the fuss is about. Based on Stephen King's novel, The Shawshank Redemption is a terrific adaptation of his book. The acting, I mean don't get me started. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were perfectly casted and fit so well together. What I mean in my title to my summary is, I felt that I could relate. This reminded me so much of my friendship with my best friend, because her and I are so close and would do anything for each other. Even wait until the end of time just to hang out and talk again. I felt this story also brought up major important points, what does a convict do after so many years in prison? Pretty much a good job is out of the question, same with a decent place. Your family might disown you and everything you knew was in that prison. It's sort of like being shoved from a lake to an ocean and you're drowning with no life preserver. This movie actually got me thinking about that. Also there is the final notion of the court systems, because we are also dealing with Tim Robbin's life. He keeps claiming his innocence and no one will listen to him or believe him. I felt awful for him, I know there are a lot of men and women in prison who are innocent and are paying for other people's crimes. I would highly recommend The Shawshank Redemption, I believe it's better than Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. So watch it and understand this movie, it's important. This should be watched by everyone and you get out of the movie what you bring into it. 10/10"
30816,"All in all, a great experience!; The movie can be divided into parts. Part one (vote 5 of 10) It starts out really well, with an effective introduction where the stage is set. We are introduced to the main characters, and we hear them sing for the first time. It's clear from the start that nothing in this movie is cheap. The Paris opera ""populaire"" is beautifully created in an overdone and almost vulgar fashion. Everyone can sing, and especially the main characters have beautiful voices (their own voices by the way!). Right from the start the drama is build up and you start to enjoy yourself, but then it fades out. Next comes an hour which isn't bad, but it is ""out of sync"". In this hour we hear some of the background stories. Two of the main characters begin to fall in love and everyone is talking about the Phantom. It's calm before the storm, but unfortunately the music and the singing stays at a very voluminous level, which isn't appropriate considering the actual story in this part. The link between the story and the music becomes disharmonious. Don't get me wrong. The music is wonderful in itself, but it has to fit with the context in which it is sung. During this hour my opinion of the movie was gradually declining, and I started to think that either the music had to settle down, or the story had to pick up the pace. Fortunately the ladder happened. Part two (vote 9 out of 10) The final hour was one long awesome final. Not only did it save the movie, but it also turned it into a great experience. The Phantom is so effectively portrayed that you don't know what to think of him. One minute he's a psychopath, the next minute you feel sorry for him. Christine is torn between the bestial Phantom and the oh-so-tender Raoul. Through the hour, suspense is build up towards a great climax. The voluminous singing fits perfectly to the dramatic story in this part, and everything melts together. Put together the three parts justify a vote of 7. Because of the great final hour you also forgive the movie for its flaws during the first hour. The acting The main characters are the most important, and they do an excellent job. All the characters are stereotypical in the sense, that you quickly know whether they are pure of heart (Christine and Raoul) or torn between a dark and a good side (The Phantom). However, just because they are easy to figure out, doesn't mean it's easy to know what to think of them. I didn't make up my mind about the Phantom until the end, because the movie succeeds so well in portraying both his sides. The interesting drama is between the Phantom, Christine, Raoul and Madame Giry (the woman who nurtured both the Phantom and Christine). The rest of the characters are so weak that they don't really matter. The movie tries to introduce some funny sidekicks in the shape of a Diva and the Opera managers, but it fails. To sum it all up: If you like a great drama, combined with beautiful music and fantastic settings, then go see this movie. I you feel - like i felt - that the first hour is awkward, then worry not. The last hour is so great that it will leave you gasping for air."
2153,"Consistently misjudged and lacking laughs, excitement or fun; John Steed is an agent for the Ministry; he is trained to perfection and one of the best despite his belief that the enemies of the past are no longer relevant. When a research laboratory into a weather-based defence system is blown up the main suspect is one Dr Emma Peel, although Dr Peel is adamant that she is innocent. With her being their only lead into the bomb, the Ministry assign Steed to work alongside her and use her to get to the bottom of the mystery  well, after tea anyway. At the time of release I decided to give this film a miss as I felt I had heard too much of the critics having a field day to really be able to view it with a clear eye. Years later though I decided to give it a go on the basis that each year will see a blockbuster getting a kicking from all critics  sometimes deserved but at other time it is just a poor film that critics jump on it. However by the time I had reached the point where Sean Connery reveals his plan to a bunch of partners dressed as day-glow teddy bears I realised that things were not going to go well. Up till this point I had felt that the film was developing a nice little sense of humour that spoofs the idea of the typically English gentleman spy; however tongue-in-cheek humour is hard to do right and it is very easy to turn the film into a very silly affair that is not so much funny as it is embarrassing. And so it was with The Avengers, a film that has some reasonable moments but is generally an unengaging and rather silly mess that can only be enjoyed as such. The problem is, this is a very expensive film for one that is just meant to be silly and it really needed to be fun, exciting and enjoyable as well, not just feature some silly points. For me the bear costumes were silly but enjoyable (it is such a weird sight that it stayed with me) but the majority of the rest of the film were just plain silly. The weather plot was poorly done and it never engaged me once. The cast look good on paper but they are lost in the material and can do little with it. Of course in the case of Connery, it may have helped a little bit if he'd even tried, but he is poor throughout and just looks like a man getting paid. Fiennes is well cast and he is very English, it would have been a good performance had the rest of the film got the tone even half right. Thurman is not an actress I really rate and she has turned in too many average performances recently and here is no exception. Fans may appreciate her squeezed into tight costumes but for me that doesn't come close to covering a very poor performance where she gets it all wrong. Support from Broadbent, Izzard and Macnee sounds like a good prospect but really they have nothing to do and are pretty pointless in reality. Overall this is not a laughingly terrible film, it is just lacking in any real, consistent value. Some bits are amusing but mostly it is all misjudged with the humour being too silly to work and damaging any dramatic value the film may have had. The actors are mostly poor, thanks to the material and an apparent uncertainty about what they are meant to be doing. It isn't the child of Satan or anything but I would be hard pressed to give you one reason why you should watch this."
48957,"Boring, jingoistic, untrue and lazy  barely worth watching at all; It's 1856 and the generous and loving British forces are in India, bringing dignity and freedom to an evil and oppressive country. Major Geoffrey Vickers and his brother Captain Paul Vickers are both serving in the same unit but, in a terrible twist served up by a cruel Cupid, both men are in love with the very white and clean Elsa Campbell. Things are made worse when, while the main regiment are on manoeuvres, the dastardly and untrustworthy Surat Khan attack the fort and massacre soldiers, women and children. Of course, Major Vickers survives and his quest for revenge leads to one of the most notorious military attacks ever (well, not really). You may detect a certain amount of tongue in my cheek as I wrote my plot summary and, if so, you'd be right, because this is a terrible misrepresentation of history in a film that is average at best. The plot is a simple ""Brits good, Savages bad"" story that might have been accepted by an audience in the 1930's but now seems horribly simplistic and simply untrue. The film starts very slowly by setting up a love triangle while also making sure we get a good look at the Indian devils in all their non-white glory  the film never gets into full on racism but to call it horribly jingoistic is to be kind to it. The characters are paper thin and none of their stories really ever engaged me; meanwhile the liberty taken with history was just plain annoying  we mock Hollywood today retelling history to suit them but lets not forget that England have benefited from it as well! The action is impressive but lets not think that it was very well planned and professionally staged  the death of hundreds of horses during the actual charge caused the introduction of the animal protection laws that exist today within. The cast are also lost below a lot of noise and the only lasting impression made on me was by Errol Flynn's teeth, which are the straightest, whitest thing I've seen since the opening scene of Blue Velvet. De Havilland is bland, Knowles is obvious and even David Niven just goes through the motions. Overall this is a fairly average film. Fans of swashbuckling will find this devoid of fun and energy, with only a load of dead horses served up to satisfy them in that regard; meanwhile the rest of us sit bored though pointless subplots while wondering why the makers bothered to put the disclaimer up the front of the film  that this film has little basis in real life will be of no surprise to anyone who has watched it."
3405,"Emotionally impacting, factually informative and surprisingly involving and fast paced; The Titanic was to be the greatest ship ever made, a veritable city on the sea moving between England and New York. Made in Belfast, the ship travels to England before its maiden voyage, which it makes loaded with over 2,100 people ranging from the richest gentlemen in first class down to those in stowage seeking a new life in America. However, a series of errors and oversights result in the Titanic striking an iceberg and ripping a gash along the side below the water level. As the ""unsinkable"" ship starts to fill with water the shortcomings of having only 1200 lifeboat spaces sinks in. It has become very fashionable now to hate James Cameron's Titanic and it is the norm now, not only to prefer this film but to actively hate the 97 film in any review of other versions! I'm not a fan of the rather bloating modern film but I will refrain from making this review about that film and will focus on the one I've just seen. The first thing you notice here is how quickly the film moves and, after only a very brief introduction to the characters we are underway and hitting the ice. Shorn of romantic subplots and heart-tugging sweeping scores this is a very good approach and it simply lets the facts of the event and the real horror speak for themselves. In the remake we were supposed to get our emotional attachment to one or two characters based on their love for one another; here the film respects our humanity enough to know that we will be touched by the sheer number who died and the manner of their death. This works much better and it is genuinely eerie to see that large ship slip below the surface to a barrage of screams from unseen thousands  that the effects are not as good doesn't matter because they are good enough and the emotional impact more than covers for them. This is not to say that the film lacks characters because you do tend to care for everyone and the film did very well in delivering little things without getting in the way of the rather documentary style form. The horror of the death is as well told as the horror of those watching it occur from the lifeboats; I liked the guilt of the designer and the guilt of the men who climbed into the lifeboats etc, these little touches work much better than inserting large fictional sections. With this sort of performance the actors do well  all realistic with none really upstaging the film with ham. Moore is a good lead and only at the end is his delivery a bit flat  but that is more the fault of a wordy conclusion. The rest of the cast do very well with realistic performances of fear even if they are being directed into generic class groups  simple but, with the delivery of the material, it works. Overall, to me this is the best telling of the Titanic disaster that I have seen. The factual approach is consistently interesting and, without our attentions being directed to one or two people, the emotional impact is greater than I expected and I was quite chilled by the whole thing. For those irritated and put off by the sweeping sentimentality of the modern version, this film is the one for you."
2612,"Soapy but enjoyable story, even if the dramatic bookends don't work as well as they should; When her husband is found murdered, the police pick up Mildred's ex-husband Bert, who doesn't deny that he had done the crime even if he doesn't admit it. Mildred is sure that Bert didn't do it as he is far too mild mannered. She tells the police the story of their marriage where Bert left her alone with two children  the tomboyish Kay and the materialistic Veda; how she started to work in a restaurant before eventually being able to open up her own place and making the money that she needed to give Veda everything she wants out of life. Despite knowing that it is one of Joan Crawford's better films I didn't know a great deal about it and decided to make good use of Christmas television by catching up on older films that I had never gotten round to seeing. The film starts many years into the main story, using a murder to trigger a flashback into a rather melodramatic story where Mildred's maternal instincts are directed towards the pursuit of money for her demanding daughter Veda. It is all a bit soapy and melodramatic but it is still an enjoyable story featuring an emotional battle between mother and daughter that affects all aspects of her life. It is delivered with some wit but mostly it is quite dramatic in a human sort of way  I hold back from saying ""melodrama"" again because normally that implies an average story to me but it did work here. What didn't totally work was the framing of the story with the murder subplot; it works at the end once it gets tied in but at the start it didn't make a great deal of sense and the story seemed irrelevant at the start. Happily this is a minor problem because the story does get pretty engaging as it goes. This sort of film is typical Crawford territory and she is very good here  building from a gentle, loving mother to a woman turned hard by her treatment by others. Equally as good is Blyth's Veda, she is very good in the second half of the film although she is too obvious at the start, meaning that I did wonder why everyone seemed so blind to her faults. Arden is almost a cameo but her sharp wit does provide some relief from the soap in an effective way meanwhile Carson, Scott and Bennett are all pretty good in the male roles for a variety of reasons. Overall this is an enjoyable drama that is well told with a good central character and good performances. Time has given it a high reputation thanks to Crawford and I wasn't disappointed with it. Well worth a watch for a solid piece of story telling albeit with a bit of soapy melodrama in there too."

1305,"Very slow but beautifully shot, excellently scored and builds well to a good ending (spoilers); Presumed dead having gone missing over four years ago, Travis arrives in a small desert town  thirsty and mute and passing out on the floor. A doctor identifies him and contacts Travis' brother, Walt, who makes the trip to collect his ""dead"" brother and bring him back home. Walt also brings bad news  he has been raising Travis' son (Hunter) as his own since he was dumped on his doorstep by Travis' wife Jane  who then just disappeared herself. Trying desperately to build a relationship with his son, Travis also decides to track down Jane and make his family whole again. Over the years this film seems to have grown in stature and reputation, partly because it is perhaps not as widely seen as it once was. For that reason I made sure I watched it when I got the chance recently and was struck immediately by one of the main reasons that I kept watching the film at times, that being the blend of beautiful visuals and haunting score. Normally films that have weak narrative will not suck me in but strong visual style (isn't that what the complaint about most summer blockbusters is?) however the striking look to the first parts of the film really drew me into it even when the plot did not. As everyone else in the world says, Ry Cooder's score was very well used and that's all I'll say on that issue since too many reviews seem to focus on this as if it were the most important part of the film. The plot is, lets be honest, very slowly delivered  painfully slow at times; but yet it managed to fill almost 2½ hours quite easily and surprised me by how it suddenly became an impressive film when, for large sections of it, I felt left out, disinterested and distracted. Of course many younger viewers may not make it that far because it is very slow at times and this will put many off before it gets better. It does build well and it is really with the scenes between Travis and Jane that the film is at its strongest; I'm sure others have different interpretations but I do like to think that Travis was dead and only returned to reunite his family  whether dead to them or really dead is another matter but the ending was nicely low key and lacking the sickly sentiment that could have killed it. The cast are a big reason this works because many of them do play really well. Stanton is great and he does tend to steal the film from those around him  whether mute or unseen behind mirrored glass. He is excellent in his scenes with Kinski, who more than holds her own in a smaller role. Stockwell is good in support and Carson turns in a likable performance that pretty much manages to avoid ""cute kid"" destruction. Overall this is not a perfect film and many viewers coming to it on the back of its reputation may struggle to stay with a plot that develops very slowly indeed without a great deal of explanation. The acting is good, the score is very well used while the direction and cinematography is close to mesmerising at times. The script does deliver but I was never totally into it until the final third; fortunately at this point things become much clearer and much more interesting and, despite taking an age to get anywhere, I was ultimately glad that I had watched it and had enjoyed the total film more than I had enjoyed individual moments of it."
3753,"easily one of the worst movies ever made; Quite insulting Even my pet does carried a blank expression on his face for a month after watching it.. A Complete cash grab, exploiting the recognition and trust developed from Brave Heart... Forced to contemplate how Gibson could soo far from ""A Year of Living Dangerously"" to this garbage... Most interesting is the response here on IMDb Its Disgusting too see the # of males who highly rated this movie.. I think this speaks volumes in regards to the thriving ignorance in American society (not implying that others are any better)"
30707,"A low key thoughtful piece that pleases by turning away from what we expect; Frankie Dunn is a grizzled boxing trainer who tries his best to protect his fighters from the pressure of the big shot and prepare them as well as he can. When his most recent hope abandons him for a title shot Frankie is downcast to the point where he humours a hopeless gym regular, Maggie Fitzgerald by agreeing to train her. After a short time her potential is obvious and Frankie starts her out in minor bouts where she is so successful at knocking her opponents out that she struggles to get more bouts arranged. With the big time beckoning, can Maggie continue this trend to her title shot and can Frankie trust her enough to let her try? My plot summary makes this sound like a very tired and clichéd sports movie then that is intentional because that it how it sounded to me when I heard about it; having seen Girlfight recently I wondered why I should bother with what sounds essentially like a retread of that. And for the majority of the film this is what it appeared to be albeit it a pretty professional and enjoyable genre film. However at some point during the film it moves away from the genre formula and becomes something much more interesting. I won't spoil anything but the plot becomes much more low key and interesting  suffice to say this is not just a clichéd sports movie. However this doesn't mean that it is a brilliant film and I must admit to being a little bewildered by the high praise that everyone seems to be heaping onto it. Lets not forget that it is a genre film for the vast majority and only stands out due to consistent good touches and the different direction at the end making it better. It is all interesting and surprisingly low key but don't expect to be totally blown away  it isn't that sort of film. The acting is very good and I would suggest that Swank is looking at a second Best Actress Oscar for this simply because we is as good early on as she is at the end and adds character to her performance  a whole history with her family build in just one or two scenes, thanks mainly to her performance. Eastwood is the same  a clichéd character made better by hints of deeper issues; I would have liked more time with him in the film to get to know what has brought him here, but he is good considering the limits he is working within. Freeman is also limited to a very small role but is still pretty good although at times his narration was a bit too much and I felt it was over used  a small mercy was that, when the film became most thoughtful, the narration is significantly dropped to a minimum and we are trusted to think for ourselves. Overall this is not a perfect film but it is a pretty good one. It is 70% the sports cliché that you expect it to be and 30% something different that is a lot darker, low key and interesting. This is an uneasy mix and doesn't totally work  and changing 30% of a genre movie isn't enough to make me cheer from the rooftops about it but I did enjoy it nonetheless."
8783,"Wimped Out; Big-time spoilers, be forewarned ... I was disappointed. Good initial build-up turned to, ""You gotta be kidding"" when the whole demon thing turned out to be a hoax. Not that I was surprised -- where do demons get paint to put on doors? OK, I can live with no demons, and the alternative is somewhat interesting. BUT ... First, they establish Phoenix as an interesting character, and then abandon him. Second, why would a father send a BLIND daughter off on the trip they send her on? What a bunch of gutless wonders; we're supposed to empathize with this? Then they just toss off the fact that they have a village elder killing and mutilating animals on a large scale. That the girl actually succeeds in the journey strains the imagination. Then, she just lucks into a kind soul who helps her and asks no questions? You have to suspend vast credibility to buy into this. Not to say it isn't interesting, but it's flawed big-time. Like it if you must, but I am just left saying ... ""Whaaat,that's IT?"
8981,"Well acted but too extreme, convenient and lacking the development that would have made the characters people I care about; After a chance meeting at the scene of an accident, Alice and Dan start seeing each other and fall in love. When Dan has his photograph taken for his new book, he meets Anna and kisses her  starting a desire for her that continues even when a practical joke sees her happening to meet Larry. Anna and Larry fall for one another and start seeing each other while Dan and Alice continue their relationship. However desires, the truth and complexities in modern relationships all see things falling apart as easily as they first came together. Perhaps it says something about the majority of films released in the cinema these days but, whenever we get one that is dark, adult and edgy it is almost a given that the critics will fall over themselves to praise it and many viewers drawn to it will go ready to appreciate it no matter what. So it seems with Closer: an adult, bleak, dark look at the selfish and fleeting nature of ""love"" that is deeply flawed despite being still worth a watch. I heard one critic say that he disliked this film because he just wanted to get up on the screen and slap all the characters for being stupid  I don't totally agree with him but the problem that made him say that (I think) is pretty much the same problem that I have with it. That is the narrative and the lack of development. You see, the film jumps years at a time without ever telling you it has  and it jumps from one ""complex situation"" to another with nothing in between. Therefore, although much of it is well written and convincing, it is never happening to real people or even characters we know or care about it  it feels like you're standing in the street watching a couple fight, you have no involvement but it is of some interest. Like I said, a lot of it is convincing; yes these people are stupid in love, driven by desires and unlikely to ever be happy but then that is what a lot of people are like to a lesser extent. The exaggeration and the lack of inner development within the story combines to damage this and it does regularly lose this convincing touch because it goes too far or does things in a lazy fashion (the heavy reliance on coincidence early on is an insult to the audience). For example the final twist in the film is very interesting but yet we are given nothing to help us understand the character it involves or even care about it retrospectively. It is a real shame because the cast try so hard and are so good that it is hard not to like their performances. Roberts is very low key and, perhaps deliberately, underplays a lot compared to the others. Owen is the standout  playing a nice guy on the surface but much more just under the surface; it is difficult to ""get"" a simple character sometimes but here he does this complex one justice. Like me, Law may not have totally understood his character and didn't cope as well with the complexities within him but still does well with the role. Portman is difficult for me to judge because I do have a lot of time for her and it is hard to be objective. I didn't feel that her character was well done at all but that she as an actress had done the best she could with it regardless. Overall this is a dark, edgy and adult film and it does make a change from the constant action movies and teenage thrillers in the multiplexes but these factors alone do not make it a fantastic film, even if it does make it an interesting film (it is certainly not a ""triumph"" as the poster proclaims). The narrative only concerns crisis-points, sometimes years apart, without putting anything in between and it exaggerates things to the point where it is hard to really let them touch you even if a lot of it is pretty convincing and realistic (at least in the heart if not actions)  this leaves us without characters we care about and just performances to watch. The cast are roundly great but it is hard to really care about it enough. I didn't want to get up and slap the characters but the film was a bit like watching a couple fight  interesting, realistic but neither requiring nor allowing any emotional involvement from the viewers."
1644,"If you're going to bury the truth, make sure it stays buried.; This is the ultimate teenage horror flick ever. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a stunning performance as Helen Shivers the girl who can run but can't hide and Jennifer Love Hewitt as Julie James the smart and mature one who figures it all out in the end. Freddie Prinze j.r is Ray Bronson who is the one left out in almost the hole film but has a big part as the one who knew the secrets and unravelled it all before anyone and was the one who accidentally started the accident because of Ryan Phillippe who plays Barry Cox the bossy big-shot quarter-back who basically started the whole deal with the killer and all that stuff by being drunk. The killer is a big secret who could never be identified but was an obvious killer when thought about. Four Teenagers celebrating the summer holidays and accidentally run down a man while drunk on the road. Not thinking straight they dump the body in the sea and swear to secrecy. 1 year later They have all split up but each individually begin to get letters and then more serious things happen to them which forces them to reunite. Sworn to secrecy, they can't tell anyone what happened but if they are being pushed about by the stalker any longer they are all afraid their secret may be revealed. Best film of mine I have to admit. Bridgette Wilson also stars as Helens curious, ignorant sister."
8364,"Van Peebles Gained my Respect; I had been putting off seeing this, and then was pleasantly surprised. I didn't know much about Mario Van Peebles, nor of his father (""Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song"" came out 2 years before I was born) but after seeing this homage to Mr. Van Peebles and seeing how much he risked - everything from finances to his family and his own health, for his dream of ""the world"" to really see life from the African American point of view, the way it really is, is well impressive to say the least. The unimaginable struggle, the pressure and the sheer will that Mario portrays in his father is a touching tribute. Mario reveals his father's motives for making ""Sweetback"" in a moving and heartfelt way, documenting how Hollywood portrayed races other than white - if you are not white, then you are the white man's servant - how at that time - no one and no other film had film portrayed a Black Man as a hero or the struggles that he or any other race faces. It is a tale that is bigger than him and despite the risk and struggle, he fights to tell it. This is a fitting homage to a pioneer of a Genre and a Father. ""Baadasssss!"" It also depicts the rugged world of guerrilla film-making and the rabid fight involved in making an indie film from inception to distribution. After seeing this I take a much greater heed of the Van Peebles Name, ""Baadasssss!"" is worthy film as a Drama in its own right, an Homage to a Pioneer and Father and as a Documenty Tribute to a Piece of Film History."
31221,"One of the few good comic book movies; I have to admit: I was impressed. I checked a few comments and the IMDb rating before I saw it, I also saw the 1st minute of the movie and some trailers ... and I consider this a good movie. No need for any excuses like ""Dont expect too much, its from a comic book"" or something like that, I really enjoyed it: Jennifer Garner is an excellent kick-ass superhero I would compare to Lara Croft's Angelina Jolie, she acted believable looked awesome. The shots in general were convincing and well chosen, the visual effects were OK, but not that breathtaking any more (hey, we live in the post-Matrix and StarWars I/II time now). The villains worked out great and though there might be some plot holes here and there, the story was not not as clumsy as in other superhero movies (or movies in general), though I did not like the (somehow obligatory for superhero characters) romance part. A little less of that and a little more of the action scenes, and I would rate it 7+. If you liked Tiger & Dragon, The Matrix 1 and Spiderman you should definitely take a look at ""Elektra""."
7813,"Not exactly Oscar material, but...; ...it wasn't really supposed to be. This movie was released to tap into the flavor of the pop music of the late seventies, and to joyously throw the finger at the corporate bad guys who dare to try and make a profit off of something as supposedly ""pure"" as ""The Music"". I have to laugh when I see this movie, but only partly because of what it is. Sure, there are quite a few amusing moments, but I have to laugh mainly because of who I was when I first saw it. I was a teenage rebel-without-a-clue type who thought how cool it would be to sit behind the mike, play great music, and have people listen to what I said. Talk about a rush! As it turns out, this movie inspired me as a 15 year old to get into the radio business. The week after I saw it, I marched right down to a local AM daytime-only station in my home town, and badgered them into giving me a job. And, for the past 25+ years, I've been the guy behind the mike, playing the music. I've even owned a couple of stations myself along the way, and I've made a pretty good living in radio markets of all sizes. As you can imagine, my perceptions of Jeff Dugan and his devoted crew have changed somewhat over the years...and now, to me, what they're railing about in this movie as the ""evils of commercialism"" just aren't all that ""evil"" after all. Commercials put food on the table and allow the station to keep the lights on. Sure, the music should be free, but someone still has to pay to operate the transmitter. Life's tough...wear a cup and get over it. In this country, we've made a conscious decision that the cost of ""free"" radio will be supported by advertising...but Jeff Dugan and his crew seem to conveniently forget that fact. That's where the movie comes off the tracks for me these days. In 1978, I didn't really know how the business side of things worked yet, but I quickly learned. No one who's spent more than a couple of days in a professional radio station could possibly escape that fact. The movie is full of little mistakes that lead me to believe that perhaps the screenwriters really didn't know too much about radio. The call letters ""Q-SKY"", for example, would never be assigned to a radio station in the US for a couple of solid reasons. The station's purported frequency of 71.1MHz is far below the FM band in the US, which is 88.1MHz to 108.1MHz. And chuckle at the fact that someone decided that you would need to use TWO microphones for a ""stereo voice"" broadcast! But these little mistakes are not the point at all. This movie is exactly what it's supposed to be...a loud-and-clear ""eff-you"" to authority figures in cheap suits, all backed up by the best AOR and pop music of the day. The plot is weak, the details are fuzzy...but who cares? If you want to see an Oscar winner, this isn't your cup of chowder. If you want to be transported back to a time when the worst problem you had was over-commercialization on your favorite radio station, then sit back and enjoy. I just wish that, as good as this soundtrack was, they'd re-release this film on DVD. The mediocre sound on even the best VHS tape players does not do this music justice. And it's all about the music, right?"
8917,"Weak, wasted, foul mouthed effort by Trey and Matt; OK, let's get this straight, I LOVE SOUTH PARK. Yes, it's crude, vulgar, sophomoric, etc. However, that's what it's supposed to be, and it succeeds nicely. This was a MESS. Every joke was based on calling someone a c**ksucker, and that was mildly amusing for the first one, boring and repetitive for the second, and annoying from then on. Oh, the Film Actors Guild, F.A.G. for short, not amusing Trey, not at all. Perhaps to fifth graders, but not me. Is gay humor all you know guys? And f**k this, f**k that, repeated beyond endurance is not funny either. This HAD some amusing stuff; the oblivious Team America telling the French that they've got it under control while Paris is ruined, making fun of Ben Affleck in Pearl Harbor, and funniest of all, the ""Panthers"" attacking. THAT was hilarious, watching ordinary housecats as ""Vicious, bloodthirsty killers"". And not a curse word in the scene. ""America: F**k Yeah"" wasn't funny, nor was the rest of it. They totally missed the mark, and showed how mean spirited they are. South Park will continue to get my viewing, but their next film, I'll skip. That's if they get another one, this bombed pretty bad at the multiplex."
6947,"Classic; This movie got it right. The perfect blend of realism and storytelling. Really now, who didn't like this movie? If you thought it was boring, go take your Ritalen and watch it again. No, I am not being mean to anyone with ADHD, my point is you need to slow your life down to more than just a few sound bytes from MTV. This is a take your time and smell the roses kind of movie. Watch it with a good bottle of wine and I swear you can almost smell the salt air. This kind of movie only comes along once in a while. You have to appreciate like a fine wine and it will grow on you through subsequent viewings. My only suggestion to those that didn't like it is try it again. Enjoy it, own it."
8981,"Unexpected Good Performances; To be honest, I watched Closer for Clive Owen. If he was not in this movie, I wouldn't have even thought of seeing it in the theatres. Prior to seeing the movie, I had low hopes for everybody else. I thought that Julia Roberts would turn in another pretty-and-outraged-fish-out-of-water performance. I thought that Natalie Portman would do another of her famous glares where she looks at you like you just said that Hitler did more for the Jews than Moses did. And, I thought that Jude Law would do another one of his ""I'm a pretty boy with a receding hairline"" bits. But, I WAS WRONG!! Jude Law and Natalie Portman surprised me with their performances. I would venture to say that these were their best performances yet. Law was great as the sniveling betrayer and Portman seemed more natural than normal. The scene where she is about to walk out on Jude Law's character was very heart wrenching for me. I really liked her performance in this one. But, more than that, I was floored by Julia Roberts' performance. I don't believe I've seen her in a more realistic portrayal. Unlike her other performances, she does not go overboard with it. I was able to see the grief she was feeling when she was preparing to tell Clive Owen about her affair. There was none of that ""obvious lying"" that only fools the character being lied to crap. Her lie (being dressed because she had to go out for milk) was done convincingly. I think she did a great job portraying a hard but good woman who did something that she was ashamed of. Now, about Clive Owen, I went into the movie expected to see great things from him, and even he surprised me. This role is completely different from any that I've seen him do in the past. There was no dark and brooding character. He seemed to be a genuinely ruthless in love and honest in perversions type of a person. In fact, he was so believable, that it didn't take me but a moment to switch from the image that I had formed of him, to the image he presented to me on screen. This was an unexpectedly good movie, not because I didn't expect it to be good, but because it surpassed the quality that I expected it to have in the first place."
7458,"Brad; Interesting distortion of the story; it helps if you don't remember details of the Illiad. This is Hollywood! Brad really bulked up for the role, but seems more like a snitty prima dona than a warrior who inspired warriors to follow him. Eric Banna is the best of the lot. Orlando Bloom largely wasted on an unattractive, wimpy role ... with eye liner, no less. Good effects and filming, but I thought the big-battle action sequences were a little superficial ... I had a hard time believing that the sword strokes were doing the damage implied. It seemed like, ""gotcha, fall down."" I'm quibbling ... it was entertaining."
26242,"Effective Thriller With A Few Minor Problems And One Major One; As made for television movies go DUEL is an absolute legend . It's possibly a little overrated in my opinion but thank goodness it doesn't revolve around Jane Seymour or Victoria Principal nursing a sick child . It is of course the movie that kick started the career of Steven Spielberg and you do wonder slightly if this had been directed by A.N Other would the TVM be so well remembered today ? Would it also be obtuse to say that much of the acclaim should be heaped upon Richard Matheson's script that brings up subconscious fears about traveling through strange rural territory ? There are a few flaws to the movie ,like it's never explained why Mr truck driver is making life hell for David Mann but I guess this reflects life since so much grief in the world is carried out without motive or reason . There are a few shots where it's painfully obvious that the vehicles aren't traveling more than about 10 MPH but let's not forget this is a TVM with a limited budget and a debut director . Come to think of it why did Spielberg stop making thrillers like this and JAWS and concentrated on sentimental crap like ET and THE TERMINAL ? DUEL is as thought provoking and as exciting as anything on his resume so I can forgive any flaws this debut has . All except one - The lead actor . I'm sorry but Dennis Weaver is awful , he just doesn't have the range or ability to portray David Mann convincingly . Mann that's his name , think about it he's everyman driving along a desert highway , he finds himself in an alien landscape with no friends and someone who wants to do him serious harm . Both the director and scriptwriter know the character and the actor playing him carries the whole movie but Weaver drags the whole scenario down somewhat especially the paranoid voice over scenes in the diner . Weaver doesn't ruin the movie as such but his performance stops DUEL from the classic many critics claim it is and if it wasn't for the director and the tight script this TVM may well have been instantly forgotten"
7458,"Kick Ass Movie!; Watched Troy on DVD last nite, and was thoroughly impressed. Of course, this was just coming off of seeing ""Alexander the (Gay) Great,"" so pretty much any movie I watched after that will seem like an epic film - maybe I should re-watch Gigli now, with new eyes! *cough* Troy features a top-notch cast, including Peter O'Toole (one of my personal favorites.) Brad Pitt shines in his role of Achilles, demonstrating his ability to convey different emotions. I am always impressed by an actor who is able to play more than one type of role. Within Troy, you see Achilles the warrior, but also Achilles the loyal lover. You see him ruthlessly waste a whole Trojan battalion, but demonstrate compassion in sparing a man's life because he has a son. In summary: Troy features excellent cinematography, a stirring soundtrack led by James Horner, a gripping plot, and a heart-wrenching, yet satisfying conclusion. Definitely worth watching - my rating: 8 of 10 stars."
27706,"Too creepy; I saw this yesterday and felt pretty creeped out by the whole thing. The scenery is so bleak, grey and depressing...the landscape looked like a surreal nuclear wasteland; burnt out trees,and no light at all. Dour expressions and crazy people spewing gibberish. I haven't read any of the books, and I realized it would have some ""dark' gallows like humor, but I felt a kind of unease in the pit of my stomach through the whole thing. Just as I started to relate to a character, they would meet some terrible end, and everyone was just plain insane. Kind of like spending 90 minutes in a bad dream in an insane asylum. I get enough of that on the freeway. Yes, there was a little humor in there. A lot wasn't connected or explained. What was the meaning of the spyglass all these people had? Why did Olaf have the eye on his ankle? Harry Potter is dark but at least it makes some sense and has a plot that can be followed. Jim Carrey was really good and you could almost smell him through the screen. I can't help think that this movie would have done much better if it hadn't been so morbid and dark, especially being marketed to kids. It's like the Grinch movie that scared all the little kids to death because the Grinch was SO over the top. The Grinch movie was kind of a bust for that reason. I felt that most of the people who saw the movie, young and old alike felt slightly traumatized by the whole thing. It was just too creepy for parents to embrace wholeheartedly for their kids."
8977,"Tedious and dull; Historically accurate it may be but I found the film slow, tedious and dull. The first battle scene is well done and you do get the shock factor with the gore and the carnage. Thereafter, you begin to expect this level of violence so it loses it's shock quality. The political intrigue didn't have enough to keep the plot moving - all we really see is Alexander's increasing paranoia. One the point is made in Babylon this becomes predictable. The bisexuality - or even homosexuality - no shock if you understand the values and morals of the time but the poignant glances between Alexander and a variety of males were overdone. As for his greatest achievement - conquering the known world of the time - it gets lost amongst the bickering of foes, flickering of eye lashes and politicking of his rivals. I found myself losing interest early and had really lost the will to live after an hour. All in all very dull, very tedious and very slow."
8361,"Ralph Nader's Movie of the Year; ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is about climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who tries to save the world from global warming caused by the Greenhouse Effect. When the Ice Age does come, he must go to New York to save his son Sam Hall (Jake Gyllenhaal) from the natural disaster. First of all, the plot is terrible. An Ice Age is created because of global WARMING. I thought we got our heat mainly from the sun, not some ocean current! The acting is bottom of the barrel and the dialogue can be found in any other B movie. Also, the makers of this film didn't care about its artistic value, but only wanted to express their twisted ideas and call it art. An interesting thing is that someone involved in the movie's writing process appeared on 20/20 and said that, after nearly three years of research, he and most of the scientific community came to the conclusion that global warming is a hoax. He only wrote the script because Hollywood big shots blacklist anyone who won't cooperate with their propaganda. That is all ""The Day After Tomorrow"" should be viewed as: legalized propaganda. The main character is surrounded by stupid politicians to make his plight seem more plausible, but even more outrageous is that one politician looks very much like Dick Cheney. One thing many people give this movie credit for is the great special effects. If you want to see a movie with better special effects and a more believable and unpolluted plot, rent ""The Lord of The Rings"" instead. I'll finish this comment with something Robert Duvall once said: ""They (Hollywood political activists) should keep their mouths shut."" 2/10"
7259,"Give Me A Break; OK, so we get the point...it was a bad movie. But I think y'all just a lil too harsh. The acting was indeed the worst I've seen, but some of the things I've seen y'all say are just uncalled for. The dancing is not repetitive(sp). It's just the style they use that may seem like you continuously see it. But seriously, the dancing was hot. And to the person who trashed the statue thing, that was one of the best moves of the movie. It was not stupid. I bet if you were in a dance contest you wouldn't have even thought of coming up with that. Once again I'll say, the acting was straight up horrible. I could've come up with that plot. Heck, my ten year old sister could have. I'll even say my eight year old cousin. I can't stand Christopher B. Stokes anyway and this movie didn't help me like him anymore in any kind of way. I agree about everything you've said as far as the acting and the movie itself is involved, but the dancing was excellent. I'd give this movie a 2 just because of the dancing. In short, if you are not a dancer, you will not appreciate this movie. If you don't like B2K, you will not appreciate this movie. If you don't have a high tolerance for bad acting just to see the dancing, you will not appreciate this movie. My advice to those who are still curious, but not willing to spend money on even renting the movie, find someone with a bootleg, fast forward through the acting and just watch the dancing. That's the best part of the movie."
8666,"Oh my...; I have just seen this movie. What a stinker. This is the worst written movie that I have seen in a long, long time. One nightmare, that I will have for the rest of my life is the basketball scene'. The basketball scene was an attempt, (I really do mean an attempt, because it failed...miserably) at the playful scene in Daredevil, where Garner and Affleck test their mettle. The character never really sold the idea of developing her newly found powers. Is was a 'look what I did' vs. 'I did I do that?' I cannot believe the writer actually wrote for Law and Order, but then again the key word is wrote. The writing was terrible, I have no idea why the director didn't yell cut every line, asking for a re-write. I have never ever before wrote a bad comment about a movie, but this one, I need to tell everyone to approach with extreme caution and do not expect to be entertained. DH"
8908,"You have to see this movie!!; I can count on one hand the amount of movies that have moved me, and this in one of them! You care about the characters, you laugh, cry and fall in love with them. It is a very moving storyline about one man and his families journey, from his brothers at the firehouse to to wife and children. Joaquin and John are fantastic as is relative new comer Jacinda, even the supporting cast are memorable and lovable! If you haven't seen this movie it is a MUST for both guys and girls. There is action to keep the guys entertained and plenty of heart in it for the girls!! These characters will stay with you especially Jack!!"
4848,"So it was all a Dr.; David Lynch once again shows his immense but ultimately annoying talent for starting any number of fascinating hares and then failing to round any of them them up again. In this tale of an encounter between an ingénue and an amnesiac femme fatale (but which is which?)he clatters along merrily for an hour and a half and is then forced to take a surreal left turn to wind everything up quickly, like a schoolboy caught short writing an exam essay. Is Lynch just another ""art"" director who thinks he can easily wing it in the low-brow genre of the thriller, only to fall flat on his face? Maybe. But there are some great scenes here too--if Lynch would only learn to discipline himself, to lay down some ground rules and stick with them, he could make films to rival and maybe outclass Tarantino."
8972,"Seems to be living in the hype of ""The Da Vinci Code"".; ""National Treasure"" is an action-adventure film that tells the story of a descendant from a line of treasure hunters. The descendant, Benjamin Gates (Nicolas Cage), follows in the dreams of his forbearers by seeking a treasure that was originally the Knights Templar's war booty from the Crusades. When the knights decided that the riches were too much for one man alone they hid it under the noses of Europe's rulers for centuries. Eventually the knights became the Freemasons and their hidden treasure was brought overseas by pilgrims and ended up in the hands of America's Founding Fathers. Once in their possession, the Founding Fathers decided the same thing that the Knights did some 450 years earlier: the treasure was too great for one man alone or even one government. While the American Revolution was taking place, the Founding Fathers hid the treasure from the invading British while leaving clues to the treasures whereabouts on the dollar bill, the back of The Declaration of Independence, and by telling one of Ben Gates's ancestors that he could find keys to the treasures whereabouts on the ship that it was brought to America on. In present day, Ben has found the ship named The Charlotte and a hint leading to a map that is supposedly on the back of The Declaration of Independence. However, to Ben's misfortune his colleague treasure hunter, Ian Howe (Sean Bean) betrays him once the clue is found. Suspecting Ian of plotting to steal The Declaration, Ben decides to do it first in order to secure the treasure. Even if Ben accomplishes this task, he still has to deal with Ian, his men, and the FBI who are already suspicious of his motives. Ben is accompanied by Riley Poole (Justin Bartha) and Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) on the hunt for the treasure. Abigail is at first reluctant because of her responsibility for The Declaration's security. She and Ben's father, Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), soon realize the necessity of the mission. ""National Treasure"" has a handful of uninspired action scenes and few great actors like Jon Voight and Harvey Keitel in the supporting roles. Voight and Keitel do the best any actor can possibly do with such formulaic and bland material. Diane Kruger (Troy) gives a mediocre performance. Sean Bean does his very best as the tempted villain, a role he truly has talent for and should perform more often (though not so much as to typecast himself). Nicolas Cage gives an unmemorable performance and seems out of place in this cheap, fast paced action-thriller. At his age he should retire to dramas and psychological thrillers, which despite being very demanding on an actor would suit him better. However, the main hindrance to everyone's performance was shabby dialogue and a summer flick plot. Director John Turteltaub (""Phenomenon"", ""The Kid"") encounters some basic problems with ""National Treasure"" that many movies of its genre do these days. The one-liners (important ingredients in an action movie) were sparse and dull. The comic relief is just too dependent on the annoying sidekick Riley. Another troubling aspect of the film is the far-fetched plot that is all too common in Jerry Bruckheimer productions (""Armageddon"", ""The Rock""). Even worse was that two-dimensional feel surrounding these cardboard characters. This film has a plot that is hard to follow but if you watch closely you'll realize the confusion is not from an intelligent script beyond our grasp, but instead the filmmakers' fast paced editing. Seems to be living in the hype of ""The Da Vinci Code"". 5/10"
31221,Worth The Watch; This is one hard movie to really rate. When i was about half way through i was thinking maybe 6 out of 10 and that was pushing it. After completely watching the movie and actually spend some time thinking about it the movie is actually pretty good. Jennifer Garner did a awesome job in the movie. All the guys will like it cause it has plenty of action in it for them to enjoy. The only thing i really found lacking in the movie is the fact that they don't tell you anything about the bad guys and who or why they are doing what they are doing. Since the movie was not really that long i feel they should have spent a little time explaining all the characters better. If they did they i would have given it a even higher rating and would have said it was right up there with xmen and spiderman 2. Overall i would say its about a 6.8 out of 10. It is definitely worth even spending full price at the movie theatres.
139381,"somebody missed it; After reading Mr. MacIntyre's review about ""The 1932 Moonshine War"" I'd have to conclude that Mr. MacIntyre's review of this movie was 80 percent ignorance and 20 percent assumption. The movie is based in the last days before the repeal of the 18th Amendment of the U.S. Constitituion which made it a crime to import, buy or drink alcohol. A complete failure in regard to legislation. The principle of the movie revolved around a LARGE stash of 8 year old whiskey owned by Alan Alda's char acer that distributors would of paid twice their weight in gold for. What Mr. MacIntyre's missed was that the time and place were during the Great Depression in the Kentucky, the American South, which was triple-poor compared to the rest of the world. Alan Alda's character was not part of a family, but a member of a community who made whiskey to sell to the rest of the country because the soil of their farms could produce little else to keep them from going hungry. It was choice many people made during those times. The whiskey for Alda's character was a legacy from his father and his ticket out of the poor house along with his lady friend. Part of the dialog was leaving to go live in California, the eternal promise land even by today's standards. Patrick McGooan's character was CROOKED, as in criminal, Federal officer looking to make himself rich from his old Army buddy ""Son Martin's"" whiskey. He was anything, but hard working and when confronted by the black man with the shotgun, even less so. Thus, his contact with Richard Widmark and his gang. When the gang found they no longer needed McGooan's character they turned on him. In turn Alda's neighbors turned on him, when the gang, posing as MORE Federal officers started raiding his neighbors stills and homes. They refused him service and credit at the local store among other things. I saw this flick as teenager and the storyline has remained with me for decades. It seemed that much of the story revolved around the old nursery rhyme about Chicky Licky who no one wanted to help make the bread, but they sure wanted to help eat it. The same thing is definitive in this movie, but the ending was beautiful in the destruction of the bad guys and the reconciliation of the neighbors. I'm surprised this movie isn't out on DVD or VHS."
5732,"Would It Really Appeal To Women ?; I agree with the commentator who described this as a chick flick because my gut instinct is that the second half of the movie takes on the quality of a bizarre love story . However any female sitting through this would have to endure a story of a ruthless Nazi spy slaughtering anyone who stands in the way of his mission and some of the violence is quite brutal ( Channel 4 showed this in the late afternoon ) which I doubt would appeal to a female audience or indeed a family audience . As I said the second half of EYE OF THE NEEDLE changes in genre slightly so for all the lads who enjoyed the war/spy story will become rapidly bored with the second half romantic interlude . I've never read Ken Follet's novel but I got the impression it was something of a pot boiler that women read on sunny beaches so perhaps the story has been badly translated to screen ? That's not to say the movie is bad . Donald Sutherland carries the movie as the cold , ruthless but charming "" Needle "" who'd probably cut his mother's throat if it expanded the cause of Hitler . It'd be easy for Sutherland to go right over the top in the role but he plays the part in a subtle manner and I did enjoy the aspects where it's revealed he's a spy and the subsequent hunt for him ( Even if it leaves a plot hole - How was he able to operate in Britain for four years after his first murder ? ) , but unfortunately if you enjoyed this aspect then you'd probably be annoyed with the second half and the amount of violence in the early part of the movie means much of the audience the film was intended for wouldn't want to see the latter half"
1956,"a catharsis for the viewer; Some films evoke emotion from the watcher, but they can only be watched once. I'm not sure why that is - I know as much as I loved ""The Way We Were,"" I can't go through that pain again. ""Ordinary People"" is not that type of movie. It is one that people go back to, sometimes yearly, relive, and cry their faces off. I know I do. Maybe it's because we can relate to all of these characters so strongly. Beautifully directed by Robert Redford, this film is filled with brilliant performances. Mary Tyler Moore's stands out. The perfect woman, the perfect homemaker, the perfect socialite...on the face of it, that is. Moore's Beth is a woman who lost her capacity to love her younger son, or to connect, really, with anyone, because of his unforgivable sin. Though others commenting have mentioned some strong scenes, Hutton's coming to grips with his ""sin"" in Hirsch's office is the one that always leaves me breathless. This movie should be in the top 250. It's one of the best films ever made."
648,"Entertaining, slick endeavor.; DePalma's all about lighting, camera angles, the perfect details for the perfect scene. All this makes for a much better finished product, and helps set the mood and pacing of the story. The story for this enterprise centers around Tom Cruise and his character, Ethan Hunt. When his mission goes awry, the frame begins to tighten. Everywhere he turns, everyone around Ethan seems to be on the ""other"" side, or operating in a duplicitous manner. It's up to our hero to fit together the pieces of this mental puzzle and figure out ""who dunnit?"" An interesting (if unoriginal) plot which plays out well beneath DePalma's direction and Cruise's performance abilities. I'm not a fan of Cruise. I personally don't like him very much. I've never cared for the way he comes off as feeling superior. But I do have to admit that he's done few movies that I haven't liked. He is a talent unto himself, and as over-rated as he may appear to be, I think he's earned those ratings by delivering quality entertainment through quality performances. Nice action, good level of suspense, interesting characters, and a flexible yet solid plot. A very entertaining (if unremarkable), slick endeavor. It rates an 8.4/10 from... the Fiend :."
30816,"More than a 7.0; It's hard to believe that this film got such a low score. It is an average score but this film isn't. This film is beautiful in every way. The acting is superb. The sets and costumes are amazing. Andrew Lloyd Webber's music is fantastic. And it's hard to believe that the same guy who made Batman and Robin made this. Ignore the critics. They are, like someone said earlier, either haters of the musical or haters of new talent. Take LotR for example. I had never heard of Billy Boyd or Dominic Monaghan, and they brought Merry and Pippin to life with amazing performances. The same has been done with everyone that you have not heard of in this film. So basically, if you hate good music, superb acting, and a beautiful and well written story, do not see this film. 10/10 Gerald Butler should win an Oscar, along with Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson. Best film since RotK in my opinion. so GO SEE IT."
6783,"Interesting....reminds me of another movie I saw...; Well, actually, this movie reminds me of two foreign films about the upper class, middle class bourgeoisie - Ingmar Bergman's ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" and Luis Bunel's ""The Exterminating Angel."" All three of these films have similar plots, themes, etc. The upper and middle classes are made up of snobs who expect others to do things for them. I liked this particular film because it was a much cleaner version of Bergman's ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" and a lot more interesting than Bunuel's ""The Exterminating Angel."" The film involves a bunch of snobby aristocrats meeting together to go hunt and party like college students. Unfortunately, murder is the end result."
7458,"george bush and the Trojan war; i wonder how many people thought of the comparison between geo.w bush and the Mycenaean king, Agamemnon. I realize the packaging is more refined today but the goals seem very similar. Bush wants to Americanize the world. He is the tool of all the kings of business that seek a new world order. The hubris here is on such a primitive level. I would have hoped we would have learned more about respect and peace in the past 2,255 years. Iam glad I viewed the movie. Brad Pitt made a good Achilles. He reminded me a bit of Kirk Douglas or Victor Mature. I kept comparing this movie to Helen of Troy, one of the first movies my dad took me to see. I think that was 1955 or so. With the advent of computer technology the grandeur of the Greek fleet was really impressive."
49355,"Whoa...; I never thought a film from the 1930s could be so full of sexuality. Well, some were but most of it was pretty hidden. I guess standards in France were a lot more relaxed back then. The movie is about a love triangle with a self-centered woman who is married to an abusive lout but has a sexual affair with a lovestruck train engineer. The two lovers in the title roles are both dead ringers for Catherine Zeta-Jones and Kenneth Branagh.....but that's just me. The film was good but it got boring about halfway through. The sexual content, although implied, made me a little uncomfortable. Still, Jean Gabin (from ""The Grand Illusion"") is awesome in his role as the amorous Jacques Lantier."
8961,"Take THE SIMPONS and X-MEN , put them both in a blender, and five minutes later you get THE INCREDIBLES.; One of my favorite pixar films since Toy Story 2. The Story evolves around Mr.Incredible(Who is basically like Batman with the strength of The Incredible Hulk) a superhero at the top of his game. Who marries a superhero named Elastagirl.But after a series of lawsuits, Mr Incredible and every superhero are forced into retirement. Now It is 15 years later, they are now known has Robert and Helen Parr. He works for an insurance company, and she is a housewife. They have three children, Violet(who can turn invisible and make forcefields) Dash(who can run about the same speed has The Flash) and Baby Jack(powers not yet determined) and almost forgot Elastagirls power is she can flex farther then anybody. Life can seems to get pretty boring. Until a secret group asks Mr. Incredible to swing back into action. That is all i'm gonna say now. But it was enjoyable, it had great action and great humor. Please don't quit making movies like this."
3623,"Rides the coattails of MI1; It's an odd phenomenon, that of the box office. I'm finding as I have reviewed literally hundreds of movies here at IMDb, that those which gross highest at the box office aren't necessarily the highest rated films. That in itself is peculiar, in my opinion. Take for example, Mission Impossible 2. It had an increased budget ($125M as compared to MI1 which had a budget of $75M) and took in $545M (as opposed to MI1's $452M worldwide estimate), yet MI2 rates a 5.7 while MI1 rated a 6.6 among users here at IMDb. Isn't that interesting? It made more money, sold more tickets, yet was an inferior movie. ""Sequels, by definition alone, are inferior films."" Randy, Scream 2 I found this work playful, innovative, and fun. It was not, however, as edgy or fresh as the first. MI2 tried too hard to be ""hip,"" or cool, and it just came off as another ghetto flick in spite of the stellar performances, well choreographed and executed action sequences, and interesting plot turns. This sequel obviously rode the coattails of its original in the hopes that MI1 was strong enough to carry a weaker installment. Obviously that tactic worked. My question is, ""Will MI1 also be expected to carry MI3?"" I surely hope not, or the next installment could be the death of the franchise. This rates a 6.2/10 from... the Fiend :."
8947,"The Best Horror Movie I've seen; I'm writing this after seeing The Grudge on multiple times. I must say I've seen it first in a Sunday morning at 3am, and I must say that, since that fateful morning, like 3 weeks ago, I've remained paranoid of dark corners in my room. The movie is about an American couple that moved in Japan for study. They are confronted with a ""slight"" problem when Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) fills in for Yoko from the Social Care Center she was working for. She unwittingly steps into a cursed house that holds dark secrets. The movie is a frightfest that reaches in the depths of your mind as sure as a surgeon's blade cuts on the line, leaving you so much as 2 minutes of ""breath-catching"" time. Very nicely made, the actors have been up to my expectations, and the ""badguy"" is the scariest thing to be caught on camera... I've had a perverse pleasure after viewing the movie, in the sense that I swore to god I wouldn't watch another movie if they'll come out with a sequel...but I enjoyed the experience it provided; it's not that I'm a scaredy cat... it's just that I'm afraid I won't live through it. My advice is don't watch it just so you know you've watched it, watch it in such a manner so you ""feel"" everything this little ""gem"" has to offer"
8640,"Beautiful but flawed; I wanted so much to love this film. I've always enjoyed looking at the roots of myths, and a ""back to the source of the myths"" Arthur sounded fascinating. The good news is that the film is gorgeous: the settings, the cinematography, and the charismatic cast. I liked the performances (that some here have panned) and the battle scenes were terrific. Unfortunately, there was just so much of the film that I can't get past. I can (and do--no film is ever *completely* historically accurate) suspend my disbelief a great deal; I can look over a fair amount of changes for the sake of what will play well on film. I even get that Arthur is a myth anyway so how can we know the ""truth"". But having postulated at the beginning of the movie that this is the truth about Arthur they go on to make a movie that isn't even an interesting speculation. They could have made a very good movie that didn't involve the (ridiculously evilly portrayed) Saxons invading at Hadrian's wall (why didn't they just sail south and attack on the other side, cause, you know, the Saxon's came on boats), anachronistic weapons (the fights can be just as cool), half-naked women (hey cool, they made Guinevere a warrior--then they took all her clothes off, cause women never wear armor like the guys do), and a slew of other stupidities (why would a wealthy Roman live up in the wilds miles north of Hadrian's wall, anyway?) This was not a terrible movie, and if you can stand these sorts of inaccuracies and stupidities, you may enjoy this very much for the battles. I can only give it a five, myself."
5477,"Lucía And A Series Of Incredible Coincidences.; Sex and Lucía (or Lucía Y El Sexo) was an interesting, though confusing, story about a man, a one night stand on a beach 6 years ago, and his current girlfriend. I'm not really into foreign films, but I find myself seeing more and more of them lately. The story starts as Lucía (Paz Vega) comes home to find her boyfriend, Lorenzo (Tristán Ulloa), missing and possibly dead, due to what seems like a suicide note left for her to find. From here, the movie goes back 6 years to show the one night stand on a beautiful moonlit beach with Elena (Najwa Nimri). They agree that it is best they do not even know each other's names but each have a few clues about the other. This is where the story really seems to begin. As Lucía, Paz Vega plays a memorable role as the infatuated/somewhat stalker fan of Lorenzo, the writer of a book she feels is speaking to her personally. Even through the language barrier, I can practically understand Paz. I give credit to her acting skills- far better than Salma Hayek and just as beautiful, if not, more so. I can only hope she learns more English and can take more roles here in the U.S. The rest of the cast does a great job as well. Usually, I reserve judgment on the acting in a foreign film because it is hard to put the subtitles along with the faces, etc., but I can tell this one was acted very well. Along with Paz, credit is due to Tristán Ulloa and Elena Anaya (of Van Helsing fame here in the U.S.). I would give this movie a higher ranking, but I have to admit, I was a bit more than confused half the time and not able to differentiate the line between reality and fiction (in the movie). It is definitely going to take a second viewing to understand more thoroughly and, usually, those turn out to be the best stories. Another thing working against it, however, is the incredible coincidences needed to make this story what it is. I realize it is just a movie and a coincidence is very common in movies, but these were huge coincidences. Nothing to turn me off of the movie, but just something that nagged at me a little. See it to educate yourself on Paz Vega if nothing else, soon to be a much bigger star here. 7/10"
8783,"Enough of these; I bought this film on DVD and watched it at home with my wife on our digital wide-screen. I didn't know what to expect but I didn't comprehend another film with this type of ending. The Others had this type of ending as did the Sixth Sense. Those two films had some interesting interplay with the mystic and spirtial plots they had. This film was simply a scam, and the ending simply showed that once again what you were led to believe was not the truth. At that was the whole of it. I did not see that the ""Truth"" had anything much to do with the blind girl or her lover. Did he even live? I enjoyed the atmosphere and some parts, but I have to feel a bit like some of those who saw ""Mark of the Vampire"" for the first time. Although, I have to say that I enjoyed ""Mark"" a lot better and didn't feel that ripped off because the film had delivered; something I don't think The Village did. It was much a waste of time."
2181,"Good premise, but films drags on and on; Maybe it's just that the action in today's films & TV programs move faster, but I found this movie just DRUG ON too long, especially when Hitch has Sean Connery getting to the bottom of things. Still, it's an interesting story, and if you step out for a coffee or a smoke and leave the DVD or tape running, you won't miss much. The premise is a little silly, in that a single woman (Tippi Hedren) becomes a mastermind at rapidly changing jobs and her appearance while embezzling money from brutish, wealthy businessmen in the New England- to-Chesapeake Bay area, all the time getting off scot-free until she actually marries an intended victim, who turns out to be a really nice wealthy businessman (Connery), who spends a good deal of the movie being a valiant knight-errant on a not-so-very-swift charger, plodding to milady's rescue. It's not Connery whose performance-skills drag the action out too long, but Hitchcock's. Sir Alfred must have been snoozing a little in the Director's chair or the editing room when he made this film, and it frequently puts watchers to sleep. As the action proceeds, we come to find out, Marnie (Hedren) was a victim of sex-abuse as a child, she's now naturally seductive BUT remarkably frigid, her mother was once something of a whore and now blames her adult daughter for cutting short the gravy-train-of-horny-sailors who used to put regular money in the old gal's pocket, and Marnie embezzles money from (mostly) disagreeable males in order to get back at the opposite sex in general. Bruce Dern does a great job (as usual) in a very short scene, playing a young-buck, randy, creepy sailor on shore leave, hoping to get a little action. We find out, in veiled 1960's language, that Bruce has probably molested Marnie, who kills him while she's still a child. This may be the secret dream of every little girl who's been molested, and it's quite satisfying to see the dude die at the hands of the avenging child. Still, we the audience, largely suspect that such an event during childhood is probably the basis for Marnie's adult life of crime, so the exposition of it near the end of the movie isn't all that shocking."
1259,"A delightful film that everyone should see; Believe it or not, Stand By Me was written by the king of horror, Stephen King. Stand By Me is a great film that also shows Stephen King can write much more than horror stories. If you want to see some more Stephen King movies that aren't horror you should see The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. Stand By Me is a delightful and entertaining film. The basic plot is about how four middle school boys decide to go on a trip into the woods to find the body of a missing kid their age. All of the kids have troubles of their own in their life. Throughout their trip into the woods, they encounter many things that they deal with in their own way, and at the end when they encounter the biggest of them all, they realize who they really are inside. The language might be a little bit rough for some younger kids, but I think this is an important and inspirational film that every kid should see. For all of you adults out there, this might remind you of when you were kids, and everyone out there who is a kid should see this and see how it affects you. This is a film that I'll never forget, so maybe you'll feel the same way about it."
3977,"The only thing I'm complaining about is the LACK of Crispin Glover; I saw this movie a few years back and I thought is was good enough. Not actually being able to remember what my interests where back then, I did however by it on video when I got The Mummy 1 and 2. And I think I watched it once after that. But recently I've picked it up, after seeing the second one again, which I must say is a little corny, especially when the angel are about to fight Demi. (On the Desodo Case: we know.....LAME)The second has less realism, less plotting and less.....Crispin. The first Charlies Angels is a really good movie. I cant stop watching it. For people who are paying attention: no thats not the only reason. I like the fighting, I like the jokes, and come on: every bodies got to like The Chad! Any way, I don't think bagging any ones going to solve the problem, but I must say Bill Murray made a better Bosley. And they should have had more Crispin Glover to, for lack of a better word, make the movie creepier. But all-round Charlies Angels 1 is a good movie and any body with spare time and a love of leather and go-go boots should watch it. ""The Chad is stuck"""
31225,"Excellent from beginning to end; Coach Carter is not your usual high-school sports flick. It is about the fundamentals of life that we sometimes forget. Don't be fooled by other critics saying that this is your typical sports flick where the team wins in the end. They have missed the point of Coach Carter. The movie isn't about the team winning; it's about the lives of kids who were predestined to fail and in turn succeeded. Coach Carter allows the audience to examine the lives of these kids and keeps it real. The direction of this movie allows you to be there rather than just watching it. Character Development, Plot, Soundtrack, Editing Transitions all 10s in my book. This is one movie you'll want in your collection. Enough Said. Go Watch It!"
8949,"""Sideways"" is front and center.; You cannot miss with the recent comedy, ""Sideways"". It is a front and center comedic masterpiece. Alexander Payne has directed this wonderfully funny cinema in a light and airy way that is comical to the hilt. Paul Giamatti plays Miles Raymond, a would-be novelist who is divorced about one and a half years and teaching middle school English. His compadre, Jack, played beautifully by Thomas Haden Church is cast to perfection. Together they spend a week driving down highway 101 on the California coast. They sample wines as they go and encounter two lovely ladies during their brief adventure. Sandra Oh plays Maya, Jack's soon to be girlfriend. However, when she finds out that Jack is engaged to be married on Saturday, she gives him the licking of his life. Miles is more sedate and cerebral. His waitress friend, Maya, played by Virginia Madsen, develops a relationship with him that lasts till the end of the film. The ending, however, leaves one guessing, and perhaps that is a perfect way to top off this very entertaining movie. I five it four thumbs up if I only had that many."
2490,"Clever  Action!?!!!?!; Think back to when you saw Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade for the first time. Remember the moment in the market when, after fighting a whole set of flunkies, the crowd parts for a huge black-swathed Arab who steps up and shows off his impressive sword skills. Indi is tired. The Nazis are getting away with Brodi. This looks bad. At that moment Harrison Ford, exhausted from several days of filming while battling the flu, defied the script to make movie history. In an absolutely logical move he pulled out Indi's old reliable pistol and shot his opponent. The crowd is stunned. Indi walks away triumphant. The movie audience erupts in laughter and cheers. That's what happens over and over again in Payback. Thanks to Mel Gibson's abiding fascination with pain and madness his character ""Porter"" is enormous guilty fun. Near the beginning he is appropriately betrayed as an Ex marine by a tattoo which is shown prominently but never referenced. Over and over again he lives up to this image by showing the mental patient cleverness and incredible tolerance for pain that so often marks Gibson's characters. ""Porter"" comes back from the 'mostly dead' seek a violent, life-devaluing, but very funny revenge. Stellar performances from Maria Bello (who hopefully is still alive and in the business...somewhere), Lucy Lu (I'm serious), and a host of excellent bit-villains played by great color actors make this one of the best guy flicks since the death of the '80's."
8814,"Without a paddle is my #1 movie!; OMG!! I'm in love with this movie i saw it 8 times during one weekend..i think they picked great actors including Bart the bear technically the second....i just think that everyone should just sit down and watch it it has great action parts and tons of funny parts especially when they are in the cave i would do anything to meet the cast and crew. Its definitely a number one movie you could buy a poster, but the soundtrack, buy the movie ....I just love it so much... i think Dax Shepard did a really good job in his first movie and I hope to see him again in future movie especially with all those improves he did.. i really liked Seth green because he is not like that and for him to act like that is amazing. Matthew Lillard always Orsa good job especially is this movie hes so down to earth and loving every minute of life that he has enjoyed.. iyet have not yet bought the movie but I'm sure i will get it soon and i hope there actually is a soundtrack because the songs are just really great and hilarious. i really wish that the could make a second one witch could be called like with only a paddle or something because they just did a great job on this and i think i heard that the girl with the really hairy leg actually grew out her leg hair for this movie. i just really enjoy this movie and i am really starting to annoy my friends because that is all i talk about and I just really wish that everyone in the world had the privilege to enjoy this film."
6951,"not as bad as i expected; i was expecting something terrible after the reviews i read but this film clearly didn't take itself too seriously and even parodied itself on more than one occasion. and who can possible hate Dakota fanning? i laughed out loud more than once and thought it looked wonderful. i was expecting the ""you learned something so everything is OK"" finish but thats what you expect and as it pointed out its own clichés it made me smile rather than cringe. and i didn't hate the guy from will and grace. now that takes some doing. i was a little surprised at the randomness of some of the magic in the hat but who doesn't like randomness. there isn't enough randomness in movies these days, or any days. and mike myers, enough of the Scottish accent. this time it wasn't even deliberate and you went into the dad from 'so i married an axe murderer'. you did him in Austin powers. enough! on the whole though, not bad, and more Dakota please."
8640,"i don't know; We had to watch this movie in class and I didn't get a bit of it. I got so confused, who was who and what was going on. It's a good movie just not for me. Was there a romance between Lancelot and Gunivere or Arthur and Guinever? And at the end when they're on that hill..I thought they were done being warriors? I didn't get the whole thing with that crazy guy hiding behind the wheel. and that guy just killing people for no reason. The producer and director of this movie were people that made really GOOD movies. Oh yea and when they were supposed to get the thing to set them free why were they so mad. OMG I'm confused. I didn't really get the part about the cellar. what exactly was he doing?"
8783,"Plodding; I have seen the Village and wasn't impressed. The ponderous, truly plodding pace leaves the actors (and actresses) in this film working desperately to save it. The views from camera angles aspect were well shot, but the direction was sorely lacking. The young lady who played the lead female role was very emotional, and acted with conviction, but was VERY unconvincing concerning being blind. Nice plot, but so predictable. A big-name cast was not given the free rein to develop their respective characters, in my opinion. Siguerny Weaver was playing her role with all the force in her very talented ability, but had, quite simply, too little to work with. William Hurt was convincing, if so low-key that it left a flat response. Once again, direction/lack thereof? Just my view lanman1us"
8846,"junkyard thriller; ""Highwaymen"" is like a serial killer version of ""Duel,"" featuring an anonymous driver who uses his 1968 Cadillac El Dorado to run down his hapless victims - most of whom happen to be beautiful young women, of course - bringing a new meaning to the term ""vehicular manslaughter."" James Caviezel plays Rennie Cray, a man whose wife the killer brutally ran over and left for dead a few years back. Since the police have proved to be thoroughly inept and ineffectual at bringing the murderer to justice, Cray has chosen to go outside the system to seek his revenge. As a result, he and the killer engage in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse, with Cray tailing the psycho as he systematically goes about his business of running over more and more innocent women. Rhona Mitra co-stars as the attractive young lady who is, apparently, next on the hit list and whom Cray uses as bait to ensnare his prey. Except for the fact that the modus operandi is somewhat unique in this film, ""Highwaymen"" has very little to distinguish it from countless other serial killer thrillers that have come before it. In addition to all the blood and carnage that routinely bespatter such films, ""Highwaymen"" employs the wheezy device of having the killer, in typically portentous tones, constantly tweaking the hero over the CB radio. Caviziel, who, of course, starred as Jesus in ""The Passion of the Christ,"" in some ways gets to repeat the role of savior yet again in this film, only this time he at least manages to get the better of his tormentor. Mitra makes an attractive heroine/victim, but neither she nor Caveziel are given much to work with here. Cart it off to the junkyard."
7479,"There IS a good film on this topic, but it ain't this one; The most enjoyable scene in this film is the one which has the least plot value: grandmother and her friend in the taxi. That was a delight. Too bad it came so early in the film; something like it was sorely needed after the halfway point to keep us from contemplating suicide. Oh, this film is T-E-D-I-O-U-S! Watson and especially Lukas are wonderful; the story is important; the message is clear. But I agree with everyone else--what a horrible way to get it across! And the children. Were any three kids ever less kid-like?! My own review would itself be less tedious if not for IMDb's 10-line-minimum requirement; time to end that silliness, in my opinion. For an involving, well-written, historically fascinating anti-isolationist film, do not miss The Mortal Storm (1940)."
3967,"clever British story with some superb performances; SPOILERS For many years now, there's been some negative assumptions about the Ballet. For all the criticism though, ballet remains one of Britain's most popular art forms. Part of this might be down to the success of 2000's ""Billy Elliot"". With some superb performances and an excellent soundtrack, this film remains entertaining from start to finish. In the North of England, people were suffering during the Miner Strikes. For reasons too complicated to go into, communities were divided as people's lives were destroyed. In this living hell, Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is living with his own problems. Loosing his mother at a young age, Elliot fails to really communicate with his father (Gary Lewis) and elder brother (Jamie Draven). One day though, Elliot discovers a surprising passion, ballet. From the offset, ""Billy Elliot"" attempts to tug at the heart strings. Introducing us to the mother's gravestone almost straight away, the film does try too hard at times. The irony is that whilst intentional moments don't click, there are moments when the film relaxes itself and these moments are the finest parts. Scenes where Billy's father reaches breaking point are in particularly brilliant. As Billy's father, Gary Lewis is a revolution. Whilst Bell might have won all the awards, Lewis is absolutely breathtaking as the miner, angry with life. With a full range of emotion the character connects on so many levels with the audience and irrelevant of whatever mistakes he makes, we never stop feeling for him. Aside from Bell & Lewis, others perform admirably in this film. Julie Walters as Billy's instructor is great, as is Draven as his elder brother. In fact, child and adult alike, there is not one bad performance in the entire film. Perhaps the best thing about ""Billy Elliot"" is it's soundtrack. With classics from bands like T-Rex and The Clash, it sounds like a pub jukebox album. Whilst not as amazing as is often claimed, ""Billy Elliot"" remains an acting masterclass. With some stunning performances and a powerful script, this film is well worth watching. Add an excellent soundtrack too, and there are aspects to please everyone."
3906,"Pretty pathetic; I see that Freeman & Hackman are executive producers on this stinker. Just reaffirms, I guess, that actors are not the best judges of good material for themselves. The truth in spades in this case. I think, as I'm sure millions do, that Freeman & Hackman are the very best around, but I've never seen them work with such stiff, stilted pathetically sensationalistic material. On top of which Hackman is terribly miscast & comes off shrill & artificial in a part that would have been a natural for someone like Ben Kingsley. Why oh why didn't they just take the moolah they raised for this turkey & give it to Kenneth Branagh to direct them in a dream version of Othello?"
30822,"Sprightly, Well-Acted Comedy/Drama That Overcomes the Threat of Predictability; Director/scriptwriter Paul Weitz was blessed with a top cast for his comedy/drama ""In Good Company."" Here's a film that in some ways resembles and is a bit of a genre successor to ""The Graduate,"" that 1960s iconoclastic gem. Even the new songs complement the story in the same way Simon and Garfunkel's lyrics melded with the story line in ""The Graduate."" Dennis Quaid as Dan Foreman is in his early fifties, a contented manager of a sports mag's ad department. His home life seems almost too good to be true. He loves his wife, Ann (Marg Helgenbergen) and gets on well with his two teenage daughters. The older one, Alex (Scarlett Johansson, in another deep and convincing performance), has a tennis scholarship to a New York State public university where the tuition isn't exactly sky high. But she wants to transfer to New York University in Greenwich Village to study creative writing where the cost is very, very steep. Almost before you can get into your tub of popcorn Dan is struck with multiple whammies. His magazine is taken over by a mega-corporate raider, Teddy K, and a new ad department honcho, Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), only twenty-six years young, bounces Dan from his executive office while also anointing him as his designated ""wingman."" Earnest, inexperienced, foppish, supercilious and dangerous in that special way the inept invariably are, he poses a real threat to Dan's future. And Dan is worried about his future because Ann announces she's having a change-of-life baby. And then Scarlett meets Carter. You need me to tell you what Dan's next mid-life crisis will be? ""In Good Company"" could have been just a mildly amusing sitcom. The fast-paced acting and the excellence of the cast - especially Quaid and young (she's still a teen) Johansson - kept me glued to the screen for the whole showing. And I admit to being troubled by the issues underlying and scenes showing peremptory firings. There's some ambiguity here - is that the only way for a prosperous corporation to go? Dan's pain at losing long-time co-workers is deeply etched on his face but is he more sentimental and loyal than realistic? I don't know. From the vantage point of a tenured academic with lifetime employment I found myself dragged into questions that I think Weitz meant to raise. Well, he did anyway. Small roles are well performed by David Paymer as one of Dan's subordinates and Selma Blair who briefly shows up in the beginning as Carter's new wife, Kimberly. I always enjoy seeing this fine actress but her talent is wasted in brief roles. And Manhattan restaurants where I eat and stores where I shop are all over the well-shot scenes and that always makes me happy. A very good film. 9/10"
1777,"The Worst film I have ever had to endure; I watched this film for two reasons: I was told from a variety of quarters that it was great and I have a soft spot for the music and fashions of the decade I grew up in. I cannot put into words just how disappointed I was by the time I had sat through it. The storyline could be predicted by a four year old, with every new 'plot development' leaping in front of the camera like a camera-hungry wannabe long before the script called for it. The jokes, such as I could define them, were also set up with scaffolding just in case the audience might fail to notice them. Yes, some aspects of the 80s are indeed laughable, however, to devise an entire movie around this 'joke' is really scraping the barrel. The Wedding Singer was on TV about a year ago and I wondered if I should give it another try - perhaps I had been too harsh before. But no, in fact, it was worse on the second viewing and I actually found I could not watch another second... it was just too cringeworthy."
8783,"Pillage the Village.; Here's a concept: A bunch of people live in a creepy village located in the middle of a field in anywhere, anytime, North America. Within this bunch of people reside a retarded murderous pianist, a blind woman who can see, and a ring leader that talks like a robotic Dickens novel. Everyone dresses all Amish. Surrounding the village is a forbidden forest, where ""Those We Don't Speak Of,"" (glorified dark crystal beasts,) run amok, slaughtering and skinning dogs, leaving their glistening corpses on villagers doorsteps, all sinister-like. Sounds cool right? No. Not cool. There is a cornucopia of reasons why you, your friends, or their friends should not waste their valuable time on this piece of utter disappointment. Let's just start with the logistics. How many torches surround the village? These flames burn eternally? Who lights said torches? If the woods are off limits, where does all the wood come from? Who built these houses? What worm hole does the food, 80 foot banquet tables and fine linen materialize from? Is this the very same wormhole that the script appeared from when it landed on M. Night's desk? Why didn't he throw it back, or ask Steven Hawkins for a second opinion. As if the absurd logistics aren't enough to bury this film, dialog so weak it could make the pope weep is coupled with less then savory performances from seemingly qualified actors. The Village makes Unbreakable look good... hold on... I think I'm going to... yes, I'm going to throw up. This film put the ""uck"" in suck. -Cherry ""Pop"" Siskel"
1079,"The funniest rom-com ever; Four jewel thieves pull off the heist of a lifetime, and immediately begin screwing each other over for the loot. Full of twists and turns and some of truly wonderful performances combine to create one of the funniest farces to be put on screen. This movie won Kevin Kline the best supporting actor Oscar. It also enjoyed 6 other wins and 15 nominations, and deservedly so! This is the funniest rom-com ever made. Totally wonderful performances from a star-studded comedic cast showcase this huge hit from 1988. The sheer class of this production was perpetuated by the seeming comfort with one another exhibited by these actors. It appeared as though they really were fast friends, lovers, would-be lovers, and has-been lovers. While the production itself was suspenseful and witty, the relationships were relaxed and easy and played out just as if they were real. Kevin Kline was delightful as the psychotic, sex-crazed, boot-sniffing, insanely jealous lover. He was completely believable in this inventive role as Jamie Lee Curtis' diabolical lover, pretending to be her brother, pretending to be interested in Ken. John Cleese's character was soft and sweet, and totally endearing, while Jamie Lee Curtis (AKA: Wanda) demonstrated pure talent as the obvious, borderline Machiavellian seductress. There wasn't one moment of wasted film, one mis-timed scene, or one lapse in performance quality. Every comedy should aim for the standards set in this work. These types of movies either have it, or they don't. There are no effects behind which to hide poor performances. There is no glitz to disguise a lack of talent or comedic timing. There is simply the actor and the camera. Nothing to color the performances but the director and the score. These types of vehicles are where you discover the true talent of the ages. It rates a 9.2/10 from... the Fiend :."
7773,"I was wrong.; It happens sometimes that i'll see a movie -particularly a TV movie- and form an opinion on it too quickly. Then I'll have occasion to see it again and realize how mistaken I was. I did that once before by criticizing the movie ""Signs"" (for which I ended-up thoroughly embarrassed, humiliated and chastened.) I feel the same way about this film. In fact, I recently deleted my original comment about it, in which I said that it pulled its final punch by not firmly condemning the bullies at the end. Now I see that that wasn't the intent of the film at all; it was to show that everyone is guilty to some degree when these horrors happen, some more so than others. However, as other posters have made plain, it also shows that everyone involved has a chance at redemption. So all in all and seen from this perspective rather than my original one, yes, I've got to agree that this is a compelling, truthful film and is well worth seeing."
6886,"Skimming; What a disappointment and an insult to my intelligence. Like children who must be fed a spoon full of sugar to help the medicine go down, here again we have a film about real, serious, life and death issues that are treated lightly, sweetly and drenched in romanticism. Wouldn't we (Americans) go to see a film that didn't include a love story? I sure would. Hollywood, please, give us a chance. These barely two-dimensional characters sketched with no variation or depth are less interesting than most contemporary children's literature. There was not one surprise or thought provoking moment in the entire film. I am so glad I waited to rent it for 99 cents instead of paying full price."
31221,"Totally Worthless; I am a fan of Jeniffer Garner and an Alias junkie. I have liked liked X-Men and similar movies, as I take them strictly as entertainment. I even enjoyed DareDevil! But this Elektra movie was total disaster in every respect. The movie really ends about 15 minutes before it is over, but they keep stretching to make it last about 1-1/2 hour long. It probably would be OK as a Saturday morning 1-hour cartoon - for under three-year old's, that is. Save your money, and don't even bother with the DVD. I am forced to add more lines to my critique, but the movie doesn't even deserve the 10 lines that are required."
174685,"Albert Finney in a defining role; This film, made for the small screen by Home Box Office, defines how TV movies should be made. The film is an absorbing look at one of the true visionary and inspiring leaders of the twentieth century, Sir Winston Churchill. Mr. Churchill is portrayed by Sir Albert Finney in a role certain to further define his distinguished career in film. Mr. Finney brings humor, strength, rascality, and an amazing resemblance of the character's figure, form and facial features to the role. Aside from this great performance, the film accurately depicts and captures the dark and indecisive years preceding the war in Britain with a strong cast, a splendid adaptation from Mr. Churchill's own writings and the sense of the personal strength and integrity that served England so well in this, Her finest hour."
7708,"Hip comedy that gets better every time you see it.; I have not seen the 2000 remake of Bedazzled for the same reason I never did see the Psycho remake - why mess with something so good? Dudley Moore as a short-order cook leading a life of quiet desperation and Peter Cooke as the Devil team-up to deliver an extremely funny movie with surprisingly deep theological commentary. The Theodicy, the nature of sin and repentance, and other interesting topics are discussed and explored. The first time I saw this movie I liked the offbeat humor (If you like Monty Python you will like this movie as well). However, I liked it better the second time I saw it and liked it even more the third time around, etc. So the first you see it you may give it a 7, the second time an 8 and by the third time it will rate a 9 or 10! I actually would give it a 9.5. Speaking of a 10, Raquel Welch is appropriately cast for this movie! Some other classic comedies I really like are the Pink Panther Movies, Arsenic and Old Lace (Cary Grant), A New Leaf (Walter Matthau) Dr. Strange Love, Pillow Talk (Doris Day/Rock Hudson),etc. IMHO, Bedazzled belongs in this company. Unfortunately, it is only out on VHS, but I like this movie enough that I will buy the DVD when it comes out. (Note: it is now available on DVD and I did buy it!) It would probably would rate a PG or PG-13 because of appropriately sexually explicit content - a funny seduction scene and some very brief nudity (movie would be fine without it, but it is extremely brief). The movie pokes fun at religiosity. Which might offend some religious people. But if you are a person of faith who doesn't take yourself too seriously, you will find this to be a good watch and you might get an interesting discussion or two out of it."
1200,"I agree...this is a ***** out of *****; ""Aliens"" was the movie my wife and I rented for our first date. It's ""our"" movie. But I don't think that this is only the reason I love it so much. The FX are absolutely stunning. Virtually flawless and basically CGI-free. The attention to detail set a high bar that few other films have matched. The actors and actresses are excellent in their roles. Weaver is the most prominent, but you gotta love Paxton's portrayal of the smart-aleck Pvt. Hudson, who ultimately goes down in an almost heroic manner, fighting and defiant until the end. Henriksen is also spot-on in what will probably be his defining role as a supporting character. The script is a masterpiece. Every time I read the ""Quotations"" in the IMDb entry, I just crack up. Do yourself a favor and rent or buy the Special Edition and watch it on the biggest screen you can with true 5.1 audio. You absolutely won't regret it. ***** out of *****"
1407,"I Guess I Forgot To SCREAM.; At first when I saw scream ( when I was younger) I thought it was kinda scary but now it is lame. The story, it has no story it is just about a group of teens who are getting murdered by a guy in a stupid costume. The Music, it wasn't that good but it was OK with speakers. The Special Effects It didn't have any or if it did there weren't many and they weren't that good. And a thing I hate and most horror movies have is the Killer never dies the first or disappears specially the 3rd one the killer gets shot about 5 times and then you find out he was wearing bullet proof vest. The sequels are just as bad the 2nd one is about the killer from the first mum is angry and wants and has revenge. I don't recommended this film especially for the kids because it is violent."
30707,"Beautiful, emotional, career best for Clint Eastwood; You've already heard it, but I'll say it again: don't make the mistake of thinking this is just another ""Rocky"" or ""Karate Kid"" underdog-with-a-crusty-mentor-comes-out-on-top story. Forget about how you think you feel about ""boxing movies"" and go see this one anyway. See it before you hear too much discussion about it (don't ruin the experience of finding out for yourself how the story goes), and see it with someone, for you'll be dying to discuss it afterward. It's not quite as ""sappy"" (in a good way) or outwardly romantic as Eastwood's ""Bridges of Madison County"" (which I also loved), but you'll leave the theater with the same feeling--tearful but inspired--and it will hover around you for days. I echo star Hilary Swank's comments during her Golden Globe win and say that Clint Eastwood gives the performance of his career, as well as perhaps his finest directing feat. One of the most absolutely beautiful, inspiring movies you'll ever see."
31225,"Even if you don't like basketball...; you'll love this movie! It is a classic old school battle between students (players) and teacher (in this case coach), but it really hits home on some of the major obstacles facing our youth today. It is a wonderful film that offers an array of solutions, extreme as they may be. Early on the film begins with coach Carter slamming one of his belligerent new players into the gym wall only to hear the player whine ""teachers aren't supposed to touch students."" The rest of the film proves how teachers and coaches can touch students in other than physical ways to effect positive growth and change. Ever wanted to know what goes on at the high school dance? This movie holds no punches in showing what is hot and what is not when it comes to todays dances and parties. This might jar some memories! In the end, this film is a lot more than the typical ""you can succeed when things are really tough"" film. In fact, the ending is not exactly what I anticipated. Although the film is built around some very good basketball action, the center focus is on the growing up process, accountability, parent involvement, and the idea that ones actions really do have consequences that effect not only themselves, but those they hold dear. And yes, in the end success that goes beyond the scoreboard. I loved it!"
3648,"Interesting take on what could have been a lousy movie; I just saw ""The Abominable Snowman"" today and was pleasantly surprised by the film. When I read the preview for it on the TV it was under the Horror category, and knowing it was made in 1957, I wasn't sure I wanted to see it in fear that it would be too out-dated to be enjoyable. But what the movie did was, at a relatively quick pace, told a story of 5 men who travel into the Himmalayin mountains in search of a Yeti. As our travelers progress, we find out that not everyone has the same intentions for this creature. One thing I liked about this movie is how they don't show the creature fully, allowing people to enjoy the movie years later without ever having to worry about why the Yeti looks so stupid and fake. *Possible Spoilers* In my opinion, one of the best things about the movie was how the entire plot set up the Yeti to be a fierce and man-eating creature. But the doctor realizes that the creature may not be this terrible monster but instead, a species that is saddened and hidden away in the cold mountains, away from humans. The final encounter with the creature proves this, when we see that their face doesn't resemble a monster but much more human-like. Overall, I give this movie a 7.5/10 and I recommend it because it makes you think at the end, something most horror movies truly don't."
30822,"boring(zzz); I pretty much went to see the movie for Topher Grace and i thought it would be a good comedy. But to make everything short and easy ur just always waiting for something more exciting to happen. The whole storyline is pretty good but its dry, and the ending isn't really expected. It comes to fast. The beginning starts our pretty slow and then there's some more exciting stuff and then its gone. Some parts are pretty funny like the trailers looked really funny. Me and my friends went to see the movie and one of them was trying to fall asleep. I would rather have watched Win a Date with Tad Hamilton but its OK 2 out of 4 stars"
8970,"Amazing movie...; I have seen this movie twice so far. I absolutely love it! I love any of Johnny Depp's movies, but this one is one of my favorites, and here's why: The story of it is great. It has a good moral, and it touches the heart. Now I don't cry at movies. I don't think horror movies are scary. But when I see this movie, there are so many times when I am holding back tears. I held back my tears so hard, but one of them seems to sneak out of my eye. I am just so in love with this movie. The picture is great. The way it changes back and forth from real life and imagination is so amazing. Johnny really became J.M. Barrie, and if anybody else would have been J.M. they wouldn't have done as great as Johnny did. This movie deserves the best, any awards it is nominated for, it should definitely win. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do. It's great for anybody. When you leave the movie theater, you leave with such a good feeling. That's all. Great job to everyone who worked on the film!!!"
8784,"Best movie I've seen in a very long time; I loved this movie! I thought it had a deep, meaningful story line, and yet it still managed to remain lighthearted and funny at the same time. Garden State had a romantic plot also, but it didn't get clogged up with sex scenes and wasn't hokey. I wish that more movies could be this fulfilling. I really think Zach Braff did a wonderful job with his direction in this movie. It's artsy and mysterious in film style, but you aren't overwhelmed by it. This film is great for teenagers and adults to enjoy together because it's still ""cool"" enough for the kids, and meaningful enough for the adults. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I liked it so much I went out and bought it the next day, along with the soundtrack, which is also amazing. WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
1953,"Come on!  I won't hurt you to see something involving The French!; The realism of this movie made it an instant classic. Several directors had tried, but Wm Friedkin succeeded in fine style. To see The French Connection is like spying right into people's lives. There's some draggy parts and some uninteresting characters, but that's life and that's some people, so it works. Most of the characters and action are believable, even if not one in 10,000 police officers ever have as nifty a chase scene as Hackman has running down his would-be assassin through the grimy, neglected streets of 1971 New York City. There's some spot-on social-comment in this film, too. Know-it-all Federal cops have all the funding, while street-brawling policemen like Doyle and Russo, who actually crack cases, have tiny budgets. Big-time crooks sit in fancy cafes, eating $100 lunches while cops tailing them choke down bad pizza-by-the-slice. Productive, tax-paying citizens in the most-important financial center in the world (NYC) have to put up with nasty street criminals, a liberal-nanny-local- government and a crumbling infrastructure. I felt concern for the El-Train Motorman's family when he keeled over dead from a crime- induced heart-attack. Conservatives like me were satisfied that at least one film-maker understood us."
8959,"interesting plot but still predictable; In ""BIRTH"" you can see a young boy who is convincing a woman, he's the reincarnation of her dead husband. There are at least 4 reasons to go and see this movie: 1.beautiful cinematography (especially the opening sequence). 2.the magnificent soundtrack. 3.Nicole Kidman : this actress will be one of the big names in film-history 4.the interesting story. but one little detail makes the story predictable, but i will not write this down because some people will hate me if they still have to see this movie. Sometimes i had the impression i was watching a Kubrick film."
30812,"The Aviator - Fiction as history; What amazes me most about the film is how historically inaccurate it is. The purported Hepburn/Hughes relationship is the worst. This is what really happened. Howard Hughes and Kate Hepburn met originally in late summer 1935 while she was making Sylvia Scarlett. She didn't care for him and was also involved with her agent, Leland Hayward. KH didn't see Hughes again for over a year.So the scene of him picking her up on the Sylvia Scarlett location to go golfing is incorrect. In November, 1936, Hepburn broke up with Hayward. Hughes, as he frequently did when pursuing a woman, renewed his effort to get to know Hepburn knowing that she was on the rebound from a failed relationship. This time he succeeded and they began an affair in January, 1937 while she was on tour in a play. After the play ended in May, 1937 she moved into Howard's house in Los Angeles. Hepburn and Hughes lived in his house for one year, from May 1937 to June 1938. By then her career had taken a dive and she lost her contract with RKO. She decided to go back east to do a play. She moved out of Hughes' house. In her autobiography, Me, Stories of My Life, she said that the romance really ended at the time of the September 1938 hurricane which destroyed her family's summer home at Fenwick, Connecticut. She wrote: ""The next day God sent the hurricane of 1938. The house at Fenwick disappeared. Howard had a pilot fly in with water - - and I knew that Howard and I had become friends and not lovers. Love had turned to water. Pure water. But water."" As can be seen, their affair lasted a little less than two years, from January 1937 to September 1938. The film has the relationship lasting from 1935 to 1941 which is completely incorrect. Three years after she broke up with Hughes, Kate met Spencer Tracy. This was in August, 1941. Tracy and Hepburn commenced a relationship that lasted 26 years until his death in 1967. Kate beginning a relationship with Tracy had nothing to do with her break up with Hughes which had happened three years prior. Since the two events were totally unrelated, there would have been no scene where Hughes was upset about Hepburn telling him that she and Tracy were involved and no break up with Hughes because she had met Tracy. Hughes never bribed a tabloid editor to keep 'compromising' pictures of Tracy and Hepburn out of the tabloids. To begin with there were no tabloids to speak of in the 1940s. That was a phenomenon of the 1950s. Second, there were never any compromising photos of T&H. Third, if there had been compromising photos of them, their studio, MGM, would have dealt with the issue. They never needed Hughes for that purpose. MGM had a hell of a lot more clout with the press than Hughes would ever have had. In fact, every mention of Tracy in the film is completely fiction. There's no reason to have him in the film at all since he had nothing to do with Howard Hughes or the Hepburn/Hughes relationship. The film has a scene where KH goes to a film premiere with Hughes. The date isn't clear but I guess it's 1939? Ava Gardner shows up at the premiere as well even though she wasn't in Hollywood. As has been previously noted, KH and Hughes broke up in 1938. It's ludicrous to show a scene with KH at a premiere with Hughes in 1939. She wasn't seeing Hughes at all much less going to social events with him. The other point, of course, is that Hepburn never went to premieres, not even the premieres of her own films nor to nightclubs. She was also known for not wearing dresses. The idea that she was prancing off to nightclubs and movie premieres in dresses is just plain silly. Howard Hughes did not lock himself in a screening room for several days (or weeks) during the time frame that The Aviator covers. That episode occurred in 1957. And, of course, in any event Hepburn would have not been trying to coax Hughes out of the screening room since she wasn't involved with him in either 1947 or 1957. This scene is completely fictional. Hepburn's father was a distinguished urologist and surgeon who was the head of the urology department at Hartford Hospital. Hepburn's mother was a well known advocate of women's rights including the right to vote in the 1910s and 20s and later the right of women to use birth control. They were not independently wealthy. Dr. Hepburn worked for his money. They didn't live in a palatial mansion. They were not snobs and they certainly didn't look down on Hughes. KH said in her autobiography that ""my family was not too sympathetic to Howard. In the first place, he was everlastingly on the telephone. And the telephone was in the dining room. Long telephone conversations did not suit the atmosphere. . . ."" While, it's true they didn't get along with him it wasn't because they thought he was beneath them. So this whole scene is false as well as being incredibly insulting to the Hepburn family. There are many other errors but the 1000 word limit keeps me from describing them all. It's quite obvious that the film makers decided to portray Hepburn in the film because she's still well remembered. She, in fact, was only briefly involved with Hughes and he was involved with many, many women. If the film makers wanted to be accurate they would have included Billie Dove and Jean Peters but then, no one remembers them so they invented a grand passion between Hughes and Hepburn which simply never happened."
30816,"I think that this movie is the best movie that I have seen in the past year or so; I saw this movie twice over the past two weeks and I think that this movie is the best movie that I have seen is the past 2 or 3 years. I think that this movie tops all of the movies that are out at the time. I haven't seen the Broadway production yet, so I can compare the two yet but when I get some money together I will go see the play and then I will post again with my comments on that. I saw this movie twice and if it weren't for me falling asleep during the second I would remember most of the movie. This wouldn't have happened if I didn't wake up at 3:00 that morning, and gone to the city. Next time I watch the movie I will make sure that I get enough sleep."
3739,"Delightful & Sophisticated!; First of all, let me say that this film is as close to perfection as one can get---look at the ""throw away gags"", the play with words, the wardrobe (Miriam Hopkins stole the show; especially in the Opera scene when she comes out of the ""Parlour des femmes"" & asks her ""Sugar Daddy"" for some ""francs"" to give to the ladies room attendant---that black dress was haute couture at its best!), the gait of the actors, the snappy dialogue.  They all look so-o sophisticated & worldly. SHEER PERFECTION! It took me 5 years to get this film & it was worth every minute!  This is MY FAVORITE film!"
8977,"oliver and Farrel do a fine job!; Very good movie!Oliver Stone is in full control of his art!He tells the story of Alexander brilliantly!Farrell is also very convincing!I believe the film is highly underrated! The script is very realistic and very close to the true facts!The photography is good and the battle scenes overwhelming!The costumes are a work of art! Hopkins is as always flawless,Jolie does a fine job with her material and Kilmer and Leto do their best! The film is not about homosexuality,but on the contrary Stone did his best to leave that part of Alexander's life out! It's a very good film and far better than Troy!(Honestly,was that the same Petersen,the one that made ""Das Boot""??) As a Greek I truly enjoyed it!"
8983,"the most beautiful thing; I thought this movie was absolutely the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I loved Hero, but the intimacy of Daggers pulled me in in a way that I was not expecting. I was literally left breathless at the end of the movie. The use of color and sound made this such a rich experience along with of expected beautiful choreography of the fight scenes. What really surprised me was the intensity of the love story. I was actually aching along with the characters to admit and realize their love. Not since Rhett and Scarlett have I witnessed such push and pull. The plot twists caught me completely off guard. I love it when you don't see something coming. I'm telling everyone I know to just go and EXPERIENCE this movie. Have no expectations, savor the journey and see where it takes you. It took me on a most beautiful ride."
3671,"That's HEDLEY!; ""Work, work, work! Work, work, work!"" was definitely not the problem while they were filming Blazing Saddles. The movie looks as if the actors and technical staff had a mighty good time in bringing this western-genre-spoof to the big screen. You probably can't make a real comedy without having the time of your life. It makes hilarious fun of racism (""We'll give some land to the Ch**ks and the Ni**ers, but we DON'T want the Irish""), costumes, movie conventions (we all know that chorus-boys in movie musicals are probably all festive-types), government (yes, probably a lot of western governors were drunken womanizers in the bad old days 1871, before there were cameras from Sixty Minutes), preachers too cowardly to defend Christian principals (""You're on your own, son.""), inbreeding in isolated western towns (everyone is named 'Johnson'), authentic frontier gibberish (Gabby) and traditional movie sets. Some of the humor is very dated, but we still love the plot-line and think that Mel Brooks is a comic genius."
30846,"Mesmerizing Drama; This is gut wrenching drama. The film disposes of its main character's sanity and soul the way a toilet flushes away a bowl full of waste. I could feel Samuel Bicke's spirit being sucked out of his chest - an ordinary man who's bad at selling and even worse at living  before swirling down life's drain. Penn's Samuel Bicke mesmerizes. He delivers a brilliant portrayal of one man's incompetence, inadequacy, irrationality and the unbridled possibilities to which a tortured soul could resort. It held my attention until the credits rolled. Anything was possible once Bicke committed to a retribution course his mind declares to be just. It's an 8 out of 10; but not your conventional date flick. See it during a pensive, introspective mood with your intellectual curiosity peaking."
2864,"What's that you say Ms. Robertson; I was not conscious of ""Splendor"" being a Gregg Araki film when I started watching it but after the first two sequences I was thinking: ""this is great directing-who did this""? While the technique screams ""Araki"", as does the casting of Kathleen Robertson, the narrative is so conventional that you find the combination hard to reconcile. I loved an earlier comment that ""Splendor"" is like a John Hughes remake of ""The Doom Generation""; i.e. very conventional and without the sex and violence, with a three-way relationship (two males-one female), Johnathon Schaech, and Director Araki's absolutely amazing production and post-production skills-along with his less than dazzling scripting. Although Araki is paying homage to the great screwball comedies of the 1930's: ""Topper"", ""It Happened One Night"", ""The Awful Truth"", and ""Bringing Up Baby""; the style and substance of ""Splendor"" is closer to Mike Nichols' ""The Graduate"" (not to mention an amusing parody of the ""Graduate's"" climatic wedding scene). Kathleen Robertson has the Rose McGowen part in this version of ""The Doom Generation"" and is generally well suited to the role. I have not decided yet if Robertson is in McGowen's class as an actress, or in the class of her fellow Canadians Mia Kirshner and Sarah Polley. Robertson was excellent in ""Maniac Mansion"" and ""Beverly Hills 90210"", but these were similar roles that appear to mirror her own cool and detached personality. One thing that is clear is that she was a great choice for Ariki's trademark close-ups. Anyone perceptive enough to close the camera to face distance when shooting McGowen, Robertson, and most recently Michelle Trachtenberg has a eye for breathtakingly beautiful visuals. The premise does not really have enough substance to sustain a feature although it might work as a half-hour television sit-com (see ""Three's Company""). When the premise becomes tired the story brings in a new character, Eric Mabious; and the film self-destructs, killing time until a decent ending sequence. A tip-off that a screen writer has limited life experience to draw from is having cast and crew occupations for the characters. Robertson's character is an aspiring actress and Mabious is directing her in a made-for-television drama. His character is so hopelessly one-dimensional and painfully pathetic that I was convinced that he had a sinister side (what was with those blue contact lenses) that would eventually manifest itself. But this does not happen, maybe Araki had something interesting in mind and abandoned it in re-write. Mabious becomes a non-factor (see totally irrelevancy) and his scenes were simply inserted as padding to get this thing up to feature length. The bottom line is that Araki fans will be a little disappointed with ""Splendor"". It is very conventional, it isn't much of a story, and the good banter is limited (although Kelly MacDonald has fantastic dialogue in all her scenes) . But if your Araki appreciation is more for his directorial talents (casting, mise en scene details, camera movement and placement) and his post-production originality, you will find ""Splendor"" measures up very well to his prior work. The morning after scene early in the film simply blows away anything similar from any director."
4976,"Every Emotion Is Triggered; I found Iris to be a brilliant film that stirred a vast array of emotions inside of me. I felt anger at Iris' treatment of John, I felt pity towards John because of these, yet at the same time such admiration for John. Iris made me laugh and cry. Iris had me reflecting on my own life, and I felt incredibly scared that I might not have the ""unconditional"" love and support of someone to care for me, and that I may have to journey such a hardship alone. Iris entertains and educates about the harrowing Alzheimers, and how Alzheimers can attack even the most brilliant of minds. A must see, but keep the tissues handy."
6327,"An Excellent Film On Films!; The 1970s opened the door to the largest, most diverse era of film in its history. Some films were great (""The Godfather"", ""The Conversation"", ""Mean Streets"", Chinatown"", ""The French Connection"", ""Five Easy Pieces"", ""Jaws"", ""McCabe And Mrs. Miller"") Others were not so great (""The Getaway"", ""The Outfit"", ""Badge 373"", ""Joe"", ""The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three"", ""Brewster McCloud"", ""Castle Keep"") And others were barely worth the price of admission. Yet every one was a fresh breath of air compared to today's Corporate Hollywood. Where every film is given a Big Weekend to recoup its cost. Or go straight to HBO and rental. What ""Decade"" does so well is to relate the sudden and rarely experienced sensation of freedom to be given money to make and direct a film. Perhaps personal. Perhaps not. Sometime with a clutch of extras. Sometimes, in the middle of a busy street before the cops show up. Long before the Corporate Overseers, Suits, Committees and Lawyers ever became part of ""The System"". The commentaries are superb. Especially Julie Christie and Dennis Hopper. Though as you listen, you'll slowly discover just how many Big Directors today (Coppola, Scorsese, Ron Howard, Dennis Hopper, Peter Bogdonovitch) got stated as ""Roger Corman Commandos"". Working long hours with short pay. Shooting a film in under a month. Learning all the steps and tricks of the trade by doing it themselves. Turning in product that was on-time and under-budget. See ""Decade"" for its message. And for a long and varied list of films to watch made through those wondrously turbulent years. Though, I would not complain if IFC decided to devote another documentary solely to that most under-rated Grand Pioneer of film, Roger Corman."
2853,"So much more than Brooke Shields' first movie; - A little girl is waiting in line to receive her first communion. Suddenly, she is grabbed from behind and murdered. All of the evidence seems to point toward the girl's sister, Alice. Next, Alice's Aunt is attacked in the stairwell of her apartment building. Again, the suspicion falls on Alice. Alice's parents have little choice - they commit her to a psychiatric hospital. Will this stop the killings? - Alice, Sweet Alice is an American style giallo. The identity of the killer is hidden behind a yellow raincoat and mask. In this kind of movie, I like to play along and try to guess who the killer is. When I'm wrong (which is the usual case), at least the killer turns out to be someone I had suspected at some point during the movie. When the killer is finally revealed in Alice, Sweet Alice, I must say that it was a total shock to me. The only problem with the revelation of the killer is that it comes a little too early. The suspense that the director has worked at building is dampened severely once we know who the killer is. - Paula E. Shepherd, in her first ever movie role, plays Alice. Seldom do you see someone with so little experience play a role so flawlessly. She is so deliciously evil as the crazed Alice. It's a shame she didn't make more of these kind of movies. - Unfortunately, Alice, Sweet Alice is best known as the first movie in which Brooke Shields appeared. It's a shame because the movie is so much more than that."
161444,"Not as good as I had hoped; - I had heard such good things about Castle of the Walking Dead (aka The Torture Chamber of Dr. Sadism) that I've really been looking forward to seeing it. I was a little disappointed. The movie seemed to be little more than a series of interesting, but unrelated, ideas and scenes stuck together with a very flimsy plot. The castle scenes are basically one torture device after the other. Christopher Lee is underutilized. He plays a one-note character that highlights very little of his acting abilities. - One scene in particular points out many of the problems with the movie. As our unsuspecting heroes make their way to the castle, they must travel through a forest. This is no ordinary forest. The trees seem to have dead bodies actually growing out of their trunks and branches. Do they turn around and home like sensible people? NO. Dead bodies in trees must be a common sight in their part of the world. - Regardless of what I've written so far, it's not as if I didn't find something to enjoy. The rating I gave the movie (6/10) would indicate that. What I did find enjoyable were those very scenes that I've previously described as unrelated. Most are so over-the-top in their imaginative use of torture devices that I couldn't help but enjoy them. The scene of our hero tied helplessly as a ax blade pendulum slowly drops toward his body was truly an amazing sight. It's actually better than a similar scene in Corman's Pit and the Pendulum, a movie I actually enjoy."

I have now seen this movie on three different occasions and each time I am struck by the power of the final scene. The Great Silence is the story of a snowbound Utah town plagued by bounty killers. The phrase ""Wanted: Dead or Alive"" seems to mean only ""Wanted: Dead"". No one has been brought in alive. One day, a stranger arrives. He has been summoned by one member of the community who seeks revenge for the death of her husband. The bounty killers are now the prey of this mute death machine known as Silence. Loco (as played by Klaus Kinski) is one of the meanest, most vile characters to ever appear in film. He tells one grieving widow to bury her dead husband in the snow so he can pick him up later. Other scenes that are not easy to forget include Loco pulling dead bodies out of the snow to strap to the roof of the stage coach so they can be carried to town or Loco dragging people through the snow to get information from them only to shoot them when he learns what he wants. I doubt I've ever rooted so strongly against a film character. The snow itself is really a character in this movie. It's not often that you see a Western set in the snow. And, when you do, it's only for a few moments and the snow is usually only a few inches deep. Here, the snow is non-stop. There is no escape. And, we're not talking about three or four inches. Try 30 to 40 inches. All of this snow must have provided REAL hardships for everyone involved in the making of the movie. Earlier, I mentioned the ending of The Great Silence. I stated how powerful I find the ending of the movie. I'm not going to state why I feel this way as I don't want to ruin it for anyone wanting to see the movie, but I will say that is as unlikely an ending to a Western as you'll encounter. The first time I saw The Great Silence, the ending stuck with me for days. And to me, that's the sign of a sure winner."
27699,"I loved this movie.; I'd heard of Alice Paul, thanks to my sister, but I didn't know how important she was. This movie managed the tricky job of conveying a lot of history without ever feeling like it was a museum piece. Every character and all of the incidents of the story were completely alive and immediate and fresh. I've watched this many times on HBO and it never loses its energy. With this and ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Hilary Swank had a heck of year. The director, Katja Von Garner, previously made the terrific ""Bandits."" She deserves a lot of credit for her work here, keeping the movie electric and exciting, and helping every cast member to give terrific performances. This is how history should be told in movies."
8784,"Perfection...; Now i say perfection, and i realise that i am throwing that word around a bit, cos nothing is really perfect, but this movie comes about as close as you're gonna get. So natural, so real, you feel like you could know all these people. The thing about it i loved best was that every time you expected something to happen, it didn't, not cos the movies all full of twists and turns and crap like that, but because you realise, the only reason you expect it to happen is cos it does in other movies, but never does in real life. life is not full of one liners and neither is this film. the other best part of the film is the awesome soundtrack. a bit of trivia, Colin hay, who sings ""just don't think i'll ever get over you"" is the lead singer of men at work, the Aussie band that does ""i come from a land down under"". i think that rocks. Zach Braff deserves an award for his acting and his directing (i don't know if he's got one for the film, but he ought to!) because this film makes you feel all the emotions of real life, cos it is real life. in a time when most people are thinking about how crap reality is, we should all watch this movie so that we can remember that reality really is wonderful."
31225,"excellent; To sum it all up, i would have to say this movie was really, really great. The soundtrack was really good and the acting skills of everyone in the movie made it even better. The determination of Samuel L. Jackson's character pulled it all together and it seemed as if the actors who played the basketball players were actually there when the real event occurred and their talent shined through the screen. The young actor who played Timo Cruz in this movie really moved me. i felt as though he were speaking to me. The actor/model Channing Tatum is one of the most gorgeous men i have ever seen in my life. They need to make more movies like this."
4932,"An incredible thrill ride; What do you get if you mix equal parts Alfred Hitchcock with Dario Argento? Answer: Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill. I suppose you could categorize Dressed to Kill as an American giallo. This is one of those movies that would be difficult to discuss the plot without ruining a good portion of the movie, so I won't even try. If you really must know more about the plot, read it here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080661/ - I had not seen Dressed to Kill in about 20 years. I had completely forgotten what an effective movie it is. Several particular moments stand out. The first is the art gallery scene. It's basically a long drawn-out game of cat and mouse. Angie Dickinson is at first pursued and later pursues an unknown man. The way De Palma takes the camera around the twists and turns inside the gallery with only the briefest of glimpses of the mystery man is very effective at building tension. It is amazing that he is able to build this tension and then just let it go without the expected payoff. - The second scene that I find particularly well done is the famous elevator scene. Unlike the art gallery, there is very little in the way of build up. An elevator door opens and ...well you know what happens. The brutality on display in this scene rivals that of the best Italian giallo. The elevator scene was heavily ""influenced"" by Hitchcock's Psycho. And, the Hitchcock ""influence"" goes beyond the actual murder. It includes the whole idea of killing off your ""star"" within the first third of the movie. It must have taken real guts to tell the studio that now that you've hired Angie Dickinson as the star, you're killing her off before the movie is half over. - The third scene that I'll discuss (or not discuss) is the finale in the doctor's office. As I stated at the beginning, I don't want to give away too much of the movie. It is all but impossible to discuss this particular scene without doing just that. I'll just say that it's a joy to watch as De Palma plays tricks on the viewer. Not cheap tricks, but tricks that fit within the story. - The only real negatives to the movie are the scenes that take place immediately after the doctor's office finale. The need to explain everything in the finest detail is not necessary. Any viewer with an IQ of the average houseplant already knows what happened. These scenes just feel tacked on and hurt the overall flow of the movie."
6140,"Another example of Argento's genius; - Plot: (As written on IMDb) Tenebre follows a writer who arrives to Rome only to find somebody is using his novels as the inspiration (and, occasionally, the means) of committing murder. As the death toll mounts the police are ever baffled, and the writer becomes more closely linked to the case than is comfortable. - Tenebre is certainly one of Argento's best films. Even though I've seen it before, it has lost none of its impact on me. Tenebre includes some wonderful examples of Argento's visual flair. While not as bold as Suspiria, it's a feast for the eyes. If you've seen it, have you noticed that almost every victim is wearing white? Why? Could it be that the red blood makes more of a visual impact on the white background. Tenebre also includes some of Argento's most suspense filled moments. The scene where the girl is chased by the dog only to end up seeking refuge in the killer's house is a genuine nail-biter. - If you've never seen a giallo or an Argento film, I highly recommend Tenebre as a jumping off point."
